### Bottleneck Analysis

```markdown
## Bottleneck Analysis: [Process Name]

### Process Flow with Timing
| Step | Avg. Duration | Wait Time | Total | % of Cycle |
|------|---------------|-----------|-------|------------|
| Request intake | 0.5 days | 0 | 0.5 days | X% |
| Assignment | 0.1 days | 1.5 days | 1.6 days | X% |
| Creative work | 2 days | 0.5 days | 2.5 days | X% |
| Review | 0.5 days | 2 days | 2.5 days | X% |
| Revisions | 1 day | 0.5 days | 1.5 days | X% |
| Delivery | 0.2 days | 0.2 days | 0.4 days | X% |
| **Total** | 4.3 days | 4.7 days | 9 days | 100% |

### Bottleneck Identification
**Primary Bottleneck:** Review stage (28% of cycle time)
- Root cause: Reviewer availability
- Impact: Delays all downstream activities
- Solution options:
  1. Add reviewers
  2. Stagger review timing
  3. Implement review SLAs
  4. Self-service for low-risk items

**Secondary Bottleneck:** Assignment (18% of cycle time)
- Root cause: Manual assignment process
- Solution: Automated routing rules

### Value-Add Analysis
| Activity | Value-Add | Non-Value-Add | Wait |
|----------|-----------|---------------|------|
| Total | 4.3 days (48%) | 0 days (0%) | 4.7 days (52%) |

### Efficiency Opportunity
Reducing wait time by 50% would decrease cycle time from 9 days to 6.6 days (27% improvement)

### Workflow Automation Patterns

```markdown
## Common Automation Patterns

### Auto-Routing
**Trigger:** New request submitted
**Action:** Route to appropriate team based on:
- Request type
- Priority
- Workload
- Skills required

### Status Notifications
**Trigger:** Status change
**Action:** Notify stakeholders:

**Action:**
- 24 hours before: Reminder to owner
- At due: Alert to manager
- Overdue: Escalation

### Auto-Publishing
**Trigger:** Final approval received
**Action:**
- Move to publish queue
- Schedule if date specified
- Publish when scheduled
- Send confirmation

### Approval Routing
**Trigger:** Content submitted for approval
**Action:**
