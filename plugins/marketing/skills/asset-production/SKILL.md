```

**How Applied**:

1. What assets are being produced?
2. What are the specifications (sizes, formats)?
3. What is the production timeline?
4. What brand guidelines apply?
5. Who needs to approve final assets?
6. Are there localization requirements?

# Full production coordination
/asset-production "Spring Campaign Assets"

# Specific asset types
/asset-production "Product Launch" --asset-types video

# All assets
/asset-production "Brand Refresh" --asset-types all
