## Parameter Handling

### --guidance Parameter

**Purpose**: Provide upfront direction to tailor priorities and approach

**Examples**:
```bash
--guidance "Focus on process improvements"
--guidance "Cross-functional learnings"
--guidance "Budget efficiency analysis"
```

**How Applied**:
- Parse guidance for keywords: priority, timeline, audience, focus, constraints
- Adjust agent emphasis and output depth based on stated priorities
- Modify deliverable order based on timeline constraints
- Influence scope and detail level based on context

### --interactive Parameter

**Purpose**: Guide through discovery questions for comprehensive input

**Questions Asked** (if --interactive):
1. What campaign or period is being reviewed?
2. What were the original objectives?
3. Who should participate?
4. What went well that should be repeated?
5. What challenges were encountered?
6. What process improvements are suggested?

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Campaign retrospective
/marketing-retrospective "Spring Campaign 2024" --retro-type campaign

# Quarterly review
/marketing-retrospective "Q3 2024" --retro-type quarterly

# Process improvement
/marketing-retrospective "Creative Process" --retro-type process

# With strategic guidance
