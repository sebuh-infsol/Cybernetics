- Adjust visual direction emphasis based on stated preferences
- Modify deliverable priorities based on timeline constraints
- Influence tone and messaging based on audience focus

**Purpose**: Guide through discovery questions to build comprehensive brief

**Questions Asked** (if --interactive):
1. What are the primary objectives for this creative?
2. Who is the target audience? (demographics, psychographics)
3. What key messages must be communicated?
4. Are there visual references or style examples to follow?
5. What are the mandatory brand elements?
6. What restrictions or constraints apply?
7. What is the budget and timeline?
8. Who needs to approve the final deliverables?

# Basic creative brief
/creative-brief "Holiday Campaign 2024"
