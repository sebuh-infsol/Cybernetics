3. Are there specific brand elements of concern?
4. What is the approval deadline?
5. Who needs to sign off?

# Quick brand review
/brand-review "homepage-banner.md"

# Comprehensive review
/brand-review "email-campaign/" --review-type comprehensive

# Pre-launch review
/brand-review "product-launch-assets/" --review-type pre-launch
