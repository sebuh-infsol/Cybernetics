**Questions Asked** (if --interactive):
1. What is the review period?
2. What triggered this review?
3. Are there specific channels to analyze?
4. What is the decision context (optimization, new request)?
5. Who needs this analysis?

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Quarterly review
/budget-review "Q3 2024"

# YTD paid media
/budget-review "YTD" --budget-area paid-media

# Monthly all areas
/budget-review "October 2024" --budget-area all
