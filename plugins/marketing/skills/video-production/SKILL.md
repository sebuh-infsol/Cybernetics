```

- Adjust agent emphasis and output depth based on stated priorities
- Modify deliverable order based on timeline constraints
- Influence scope and detail level based on context

### --interactive Parameter

**Purpose**: Guide through discovery questions for comprehensive input

**Questions Asked** (if --interactive):
1. What type of video is being produced?
2. What is the target length?
3. Where will this video be distributed?
4. What is the budget range?
5. What is the production timeline?
6. What style/tone is appropriate?

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Brand video
/video-production "Company Story" --video-type brand

# Product demo
/video-production "Product X Demo" --video-type product

# Social content
/video-production "Feature Highlights" --video-type social
