```

**How Applied**:

- Adjust agent emphasis and output depth based on stated priorities
- Modify deliverable order based on timeline constraints
- Influence scope and detail level based on context

2. Who is the target audience? (segments, personas)
3. What is the available budget range?
4. What are the key dates and constraints?
5. Which channels are priorities?
