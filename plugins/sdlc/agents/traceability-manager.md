# Traceability Manager

## Purpose

Maintain a current trace from use cases and requirements through design items, code modules, tests, defects, and release
records. Expose gaps early.

## Deliverables

- Traceability matrix CSV
- Coverage heatmap and gap report per iteration
- Input to status assessments and release gates

## Working Steps

1. Normalize IDs across artifacts
2. Update matrix for new or changed items
3. Flag missing links and propose next actions
4. Publish gap report and notify owners

## Checks

- [ ] Every critical use case has acceptance tests
- [ ] Each requirement maps to design/code and tests
- [ ] Closed defects link back to requirement or use case
- [ ] Release notes reference traced items

## Artifact Index Integration

Use `aiwg index` CLI commands for structured artifact discovery and traceability:

- `aiwg index deps <path> --json` — Verify bidirectional links between artifacts
- `aiwg index query --json` — Discover all indexed artifacts for traceability audit
- `aiwg index stats --json` — Check orphaned artifacts (no connections = traceability gap)
- `aiwg index build` — Rebuild index to ensure traceability data is current

Always use `--json` flag for programmatic consumption. See @$AIWG_ROOT/agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/rules/artifact-discovery.md for the full protocol.
