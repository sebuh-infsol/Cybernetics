## Cloud Architecture Patterns

### High Availability Architecture

```hcl
# IaC: Multi-AZ deployment
resource "aws_instance" "app" {
  count             = 3
  ami               = var.app_ami
  instance_type     = "t3.medium"
  availability_zone = element(var.azs, count.index)

  tags = {
    Name = "app-${count.index}"
    Environment = var.environment
  }
}

resource "aws_lb" "app" {
  name               = "app-lb"
  load_balancer_type = "application"
  subnets            = aws_subnet.public[*].id
  security_groups    = [aws_security_group.lb.id]
}

resource "aws_lb_target_group" "app" {
  name     = "app-tg"
  port     = 8080
  protocol = "HTTP"
  vpc_id   = aws_vpc.main.id

  health_check {
    path                = "/health"
    interval            = 30
    timeout             = 5
    healthy_threshold   = 2
    unhealthy_threshold = 2
  }
}
```

### Auto-Scaling Configuration

```hcl
# Auto Scaling Group
resource "aws_autoscaling_group" "app" {
  name                = "app-asg"
  vpc_zone_identifier = aws_subnet.private[*].id
  target_group_arns   = [aws_lb_target_group.app.arn]

  min_size         = 2
  max_size         = 10
  desired_capacity = 2

  launch_template {
    id      = aws_launch_template.app.id
    version = "$Latest"
  }

  tag {
    key                 = "Name"
    value               = "app-instance"
    propagate_at_launch = true
  }
}

# CPU-based scaling
resource "aws_autoscaling_policy" "cpu" {
  name                   = "cpu-scaling"
  autoscaling_group_name = aws_autoscaling_group.app.name
  policy_type            = "TargetTrackingScaling"

  target_tracking_configuration {
    predefined_metric_specification {
      predefined_metric_type = "ASGAverageCPUUtilization"
    }
    target_value = 60.0
  }
}

# Request count scaling
resource "aws_autoscaling_policy" "requests" {
  name                   = "request-scaling"
  autoscaling_group_name = aws_autoscaling_group.app.name
  policy_type            = "TargetTrackingScaling"

  target_tracking_configuration {
    predefined_metric_specification {
      predefined_metric_type = "ALBRequestCountPerTarget"
    }
    target_value = 1000.0
  }
}
```

### Serverless Architecture

```hcl
# Lambda function with API Gateway
resource "aws_lambda_function" "api" {
  filename      = "lambda.zip"
  function_name = "api-handler"
  role          = aws_iam_role.lambda.arn
  handler       = "index.handler"
  runtime       = "nodejs18.x"

  environment {
    variables = {
      TABLE_NAME = aws_dynamodb_table.data.name
    }
  }
}

resource "aws_apigatewayv2_api" "api" {
  name          = "api-gateway"
  protocol_type = "HTTP"
}

resource "aws_apigatewayv2_integration" "lambda" {
  api_id             = aws_apigatewayv2_api.api.id
  integration_type   = "AWS_PROXY"
  integration_uri    = aws_lambda_function.api.invoke_arn
  integration_method = "POST"
}
```

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### Right-Sizing Resources

```bash
# AWS: Analyze CloudWatch metrics for right-sizing
aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics \
  --namespace AWS/EC2 \
  --metric-name CPUUtilization \
  --dimensions Name=InstanceId,Value=i-1234567890abcdef0 \
  --start-time 2024-01-01T00:00:00Z \
  --end-time 2024-01-31T23:59:59Z \
  --period 86400 \
  --statistics Average

# Get cost recommendations
aws ce get-rightsizing-recommendation \
  --service AmazonEC2
```

### Reserved Instances and Savings Plans

```hcl
# Cost optimization with reserved instances
# Analyze 30-day usage patterns first
data "aws_ec2_instance_type_offerings" "available" {
  filter {
    name   = "instance-type"
    values = ["t3.medium", "t3.large"]
  }
}

# Document RI purchase recommendations
# 1-year no-upfront for flexibility
# 3-year all-upfront for maximum savings
```

### Spot Instances for Batch Workloads

```hcl
resource "aws_launch_template" "batch" {
  name_prefix   = "batch-"
  instance_type = "c5.large"

  instance_market_options {
    market_type = "spot"

    spot_options {
      max_price          = "0.05"
      spot_instance_type = "one-time"
    }
  }
}
```

## Security Best Practices

### IAM Least Privilege

```hcl
# Principle of least privilege
data "aws_iam_policy_document" "app" {
  statement {
    actions = [
      "s3:GetObject",
      "s3:PutObject"
    ]
    resources = [
      "${aws_s3_bucket.data.arn}/*"
    ]
  }

  statement {
    actions = [
      "dynamodb:GetItem",
      "dynamodb:PutItem",
      "dynamodb:Query"
    ]
    resources = [
      aws_dynamodb_table.data.arn
    ]
  }
}

resource "aws_iam_role_policy" "app" {
  name   = "app-policy"
  role   = aws_iam_role.app.id
  policy = data.aws_iam_policy_document.app.json
}
```

### Network Security

```hcl
# Security groups with minimal access
resource "aws_security_group" "app" {
  name        = "app-sg"
  description = "Application security group"
  vpc_id      = aws_vpc.main.id

  ingress {
    from_port       = 8080
    to_port         = 8080
    protocol        = "tcp"
    security_groups = [aws_security_group.lb.id]
    description     = "Allow from load balancer only"
  }

  egress {
    from_port   = 443
    to_port     = 443
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
    description = "HTTPS to internet"
  }
}

# Network ACLs for additional layer
resource "aws_network_acl" "private" {
  vpc_id     = aws_vpc.main.id
  subnet_ids = aws_subnet.private[*].id

  ingress {
    rule_no    = 100
    protocol   = "tcp"
    action     = "allow"
    cidr_block = var.vpc_cidr
    from_port  = 0
    to_port    = 65535
  }
}
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

```hcl
# CloudWatch alarms
resource "aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm" "cpu_high" {
  alarm_name          = "cpu-utilization-high"
  comparison_operator = "GreaterThanThreshold"
  evaluation_periods  = "2"
  metric_name         = "CPUUtilization"
  namespace           = "AWS/EC2"
  period              = "300"
  statistic           = "Average"
  threshold           = "80"
  alarm_description   = "CPU utilization is too high"
  alarm_actions       = [aws_sns_topic.alerts.arn]

  dimensions = {
    AutoScalingGroupName = aws_autoscaling_group.app.name
  }
}

resource "aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm" "cost_anomaly" {
  alarm_name          = "cost-anomaly-detected"
  comparison_operator = "GreaterThanThreshold"
  evaluation_periods  = "1"
  metric_name         = "EstimatedCharges"
  namespace           = "AWS/Billing"
  period              = "86400"
  statistic           = "Maximum"
  threshold           = var.daily_cost_threshold
  alarm_description   = "Daily cost exceeds threshold"
  alarm_actions       = [aws_sns_topic.billing_alerts.arn]
}
```

- **Monitor Continuously**: Metrics, logs, traces, cost tracking

### Success Metrics
- **Availability**: >99.9% uptime for production services
- **Cost Efficiency**: Within 10% of budget, optimized resource utilization
- **Deployment Speed**: IaC deployments <15 minutes
- **Recovery Time**: RTO <1 hour, RPO <15 minutes
