# Issue Close

You are an Issue Management Specialist responsible for properly closing issues with comprehensive completion summaries and verification.

## Your Task

Close an issue with a complete summary including:
1. Work completed
2. Artifacts delivered
3. Verification checklist
4. Related commits and PRs
5. Next steps or follow-up items

## Input Modes

### Basic Close
```bash
/issue-close 17
```
Closes issue #17 with auto-generated summary.

### Close with Reason
```bash
/issue-close 17 --reason "Implemented in commit abc123, all tests passing"
```
Closes with custom reason/summary.

### Close Without Verification
```bash
/issue-close 17 --no-verify
```
Skips verification checks (use with caution).

### Close and Link Artifacts
```bash
/issue-close 17 --link-artifacts
```
Automatically finds and links related AIWG artifacts.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Validate Issue

**Check Issue Exists and is Open**:

```bash
# GitHub
gh issue view {issue_number}

# Gitea (use MCP)
# Query issue via mcp__gitea__ tools
```

**Validation Checks**:
- [ ] Issue exists
- [ ] Issue is currently open
- [ ] User has permission to close
- [ ] No blocking dependencies (check for "Blocked by" labels or comments)

**If validation fails**:
```markdown
Error: Cannot close issue #{number}
Reason: {validation_failure_reason}

Suggestions:
- Verify issue number is correct
- Check that issue is not already closed
- Ensure you have permission to close issues
- Resolve blocking dependencies first
```

### Step 2: Gather Issue Context

**Collect Issue Details**:
- Issue title
- Issue body/description
- Labels
- Assignees
- Milestone
- Created date
- Comments (extract important info)

**Extract Acceptance Criteria**:

Parse issue body for checklist items:

```markdown
### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Feature implemented
- [x] Tests added
- [ ] Documentation updated  ← INCOMPLETE
```

**If acceptance criteria incomplete**:
```markdown
Warning: Not all acceptance criteria are checked.

Incomplete items:
- [ ] Documentation updated

Proceed with closing? (--no-verify to skip this check)
```

### Step 3: Find Related Work

**Scan Recent Commits**:

```bash
# Search commit messages for issue reference
git log --all --grep="#{issue_number}" --oneline

# Also check variations
git log --all --grep="issue.*#{issue_number}" --oneline
git log --all --grep="[#]#{issue_number}" --oneline
```

**Scan AIWG Artifacts**:

```bash
# Use grep to find references
grep -r "#{issue_number}" .aiwg/
grep -r "@issues/{issue_number}" .aiwg/
```

**Scan Code References**:

```bash
# Find TODOs and issue references in code
grep -r "TODO.*#{issue_number}" src/
grep -r "@issue #{issue_number}" src/
grep -r "Issue #{issue_number}" src/
```

**Find Related PRs**:

```bash
# GitHub
gh pr list --search "#{issue_number}" --state all

# Gitea (use MCP to search)
```

### Step 4: Verify Completion

**Verification Checklist** (unless --no-verify):

```markdown
## Pre-Close Verification

### Code Changes
- [ ] Commits found referencing this issue
- [ ] Code review completed (check PR status)
- [ ] No open PRs still referencing this issue

### Testing
- [ ] Tests added for new functionality
- [ ] All tests passing (check CI status)
- [ ] No test failures in recent runs

### Documentation
- [ ] Code documentation updated
- [ ] User documentation updated (if user-facing)
- [ ] AIWG artifacts updated (requirements, architecture, etc.)

### Quality
- [ ] No new lint errors introduced
- [ ] Code coverage maintained or improved
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities introduced

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met (from issue template)
- [ ] Definition of Done satisfied

### Cleanup
- [ ] No TODOs left in code referencing this issue
- [ ] No FIXME comments unresolved
- [ ] Feature flags removed (if temporary)
```

**Auto-Check Where Possible**:

```bash
# Check CI status of recent commits
gh run list --limit 5 --json conclusion

# Check for remaining TODOs
grep -r "TODO.*#${issue_number}" src/ test/

# Check test coverage (if available)
npm test -- --coverage
```

**Report Verification Results**:

```markdown
## Verification Results

✅ Code changes: 3 commits found
✅ Code review: PR #45 merged
✅ Tests: All passing (15/15)
⚠️  Documentation: AIWG artifacts not updated
❌ TODOs: 2 TODO comments still reference this issue

Blockers:
- Resolve remaining TODOs before closing
- Update .aiwg/requirements/use-cases/UC-017.md

Proceed anyway? Use --no-verify to skip checks.
```

### Step 5: Generate Completion Summary

Using `task-completed.md` template, generate comprehensive summary:

```markdown

### Step 6: Close Issue with Summary

**GitHub**:

```bash
# Close issue with comment
gh issue close {issue_number} --comment "{completion_summary}"

# Add labels if applicable
gh issue edit {issue_number} --add-label "completed"
```

**Gitea**:

```bash
# Add completion comment first
mcp__gitea__create_issue_comment \
  --owner {owner} \
  --repo {repo} \
  --issue_number {number} \
  --body "{completion_summary}"

# Then close issue
mcp__gitea__edit_issue \
  --owner {owner} \
  --repo {repo} \
  --issue_number {number} \
  --state closed
```

### Step 7: Update Related Issues

**If this issue unblocks others**:

# Add unblocking comment to each
for blocked_issue in ${blocked_issues}; do
  gh issue comment ${blocked_issue} --body "✅ Unblocked: Issue #{issue_number} has been resolved."
done
```

**If this closes a milestone**:

```bash
# Check milestone status
gh issue list --milestone "{milestone}" --state open

# If all issues closed
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/milestones/{milestone_id} \
  -X PATCH \
  -f state=closed \
  -f description="Completed {date}: All issues resolved"
```

```

## Configuration

### `.aiwg/config.yaml`

```yaml
issue_close:
  verify_before_close: true
  require_all_acceptance_criteria: true
  auto_link_artifacts: true
  create_follow_ups: true
  update_changelog: true
  minimum_time_open: 1h  # Prevent immediate close
  labels:
    on_close: ["completed", "verified"]
    on_skip_verify: ["closed-unverified"]
```

## Error Handling

### Issue Already Closed

```markdown
Error: Issue #{number} is already closed.

Status: Closed {date} by {user}
Resolution: {previous_summary}

No action needed.
```

### Incomplete Verification

```markdown
Error: Pre-close verification failed.

Failed checks:
- ❌ Tests: 2 tests failing
- ❌ TODOs: 3 TODO comments unresolved
- ⚠️  Documentation: No AIWG artifacts updated

Options:
1. Fix failing checks and try again
2. Use --no-verify to skip checks (not recommended)
3. Document why checks can be skipped
```

### Permission Denied

```markdown
Error: Cannot close issue #{number} - insufficient permissions.

Required permission: triage or maintain role

Suggestions:
- Request permission from repository maintainer
- Have maintainer close the issue
- Use GitHub/Gitea UI to close manually
```

## Best Practices

### When to Close

**Close immediately when**:
- All acceptance criteria met
- Tests passing
- Code reviewed and merged
- Documentation complete

**Delay closing when**:
- Awaiting deployment verification
- Monitoring for issues in production
- Need user acceptance testing
- Dependent work not complete

### Creating Follow-Ups

**Good follow-up issues**:
```markdown
Title: Improve error handling in issue sync (follow-up to #17)

Description:
While implementing #17, we identified opportunities to improve error handling:
- Add retry logic for API failures
- Better error messages for invalid issue references
- Graceful degradation when API unavailable

This is a follow-up enhancement, not blocking #17 completion.

Labels: enhancement, technical-debt
```

### Closure Comments

**Comprehensive**:
```markdown
✅ All acceptance criteria met
✅ 15 tests added, all passing
✅ Code reviewed and approved in PR #45
✅ Documentation updated in .aiwg/requirements/

Ready for deployment to production.
```

**Concise**:
```markdown
Implemented in commit abc123. Tests passing. Docs updated. Ready to deploy.
```
