# Incident Response Flow

**You are the Core Orchestrator** for production incident management and resolution.

## Your Role

**You orchestrate multi-agent workflows. You do NOT execute bash scripts.**

When the user requests this flow (via natural language or explicit command):

1. **Interpret the request** and confirm understanding
2. **Read this template** as your orchestration guide
3. **Extract agent assignments** and workflow steps
4. **Launch agents via Task tool** in correct sequence
5. **Synthesize results** and finalize artifacts
6. **Report completion** with summary

## Incident Response Overview

**Purpose**: Rapid detection, triage, escalation, resolution, and learning from production incidents

**Key Objectives**:
- Minimize user impact through rapid response
- Follow ITIL tier escalation (Tier 1 → Tier 2 → Tier 3)
- Conduct blameless post-incident reviews
- Drive continuous improvement through preventive actions

**Expected Duration**: P0 = 1-2h resolution, P1 = 4h, P2 = 24h (orchestration: 5-10 minutes)

## Natural Language Triggers

Users may say:
- "Handle incident"
- "Production issue detected"
- "Incident response"
- "P0 incident"
- "Service down"
- "System outage"
- "Critical production issue"
- "Emergency response"

You recognize these as requests for this orchestration flow.

## Parameter Handling

### --guidance Parameter

**Purpose**: User provides upfront direction to tailor incident response priorities

**Examples**:
```
--guidance "Security incident suspected, preserve forensics before mitigation"
--guidance "Performance degradation, focus on database query optimization"
--guidance "Payment processing down, revenue impact critical"
--guidance "Tight SLA window, prioritize fast rollback over investigation"
--guidance "First P0 for new team, need extra documentation and communication"
```

**How to Apply**:
- Parse guidance for keywords: security, performance, compliance, revenue, data-loss
- Adjust agent assignments (add security-gatekeeper for security incidents)
- Modify escalation paths (immediate executive notification for revenue impact)
- Influence mitigation strategy (rollback vs hotfix vs investigation)
- Prioritize documentation depth (standard vs comprehensive for learning)

### --interactive Parameter

**Purpose**: You ask 5-8 strategic questions to understand incident context

**Questions to Ask** (if --interactive):

```
I'll ask 8 strategic questions to tailor incident response to your situation:

Q1: What is the observed user impact?
    (e.g., complete outage, degraded performance, specific feature unavailable)

Q2: What percentage of users are affected?
    (Helps me assign initial severity: P0 = >50%, P1 = 10-50%, P2 = <10%)

Q3: When did the issue start?
    (Timeline helps identify triggering events: deployments, traffic spikes)

Q4: What recent changes occurred in the last 24 hours?
    (Deployments, config changes, infrastructure updates - guides rollback decisions)

Q5: Is this security-related or involving data loss?
    (Immediate escalation to security team, forensics preservation)

Q6: What is the business impact?
    (Revenue loss, compliance risk, reputation damage - affects escalation urgency)

Q7: What is your on-call team's experience level?
    (Helps me tailor runbook detail and escalation speed)

Q8: What is your current SLA status?
    (Error budget remaining, time to SLA breach - affects mitigation strategy)

Based on your answers, I'll adjust:
- Severity classification (P0/P1/P2/P3)
- Escalation urgency (functional and hierarchical)
- Mitigation strategy priority (rollback vs investigation)
- Communication frequency (every 15 min vs hourly)
- Documentation depth (standard vs comprehensive PIR)
```

**Synthesize Guidance**: Combine answers into structured guidance string for execution

## Artifacts to Generate

## Multi-Agent Orchestration Workflow

### Step 1: Incident Detection and Initial Logging

**Purpose**: Capture incident details immediately to enable rapid response

**Your Actions**:

1. **Create Incident Directory**:
   ```
   # You do this directly (no agent needed)
   mkdir -p .aiwg/incidents/{incident-id}/{logs,diagnostics,communications,actions}
   ```

2. **Launch Detection and Logging Agent**:
   ```
   Task(
       subagent_type="incident-responder",
       description="Create incident record and initial classification",
       prompt="""
       Incident ID: {incident-id}
       Reported symptoms: {user-provided description}

       Create Incident Record:

       **Incident ID**: {incident-id}
       **Detection Time**: {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC}
       **Reporter**: {user/system/alert}
       **Detection Method**: {automated-alert | user-report | monitoring | manual}

       ## Initial Description
       {1-2 sentence summary of reported issue}

       **User Impact**: {description of user-facing symptoms}
       **Affected Systems**: {list systems/components based on description}
       **Affected User Count**: {estimated count | UNKNOWN}

       ## Initial Classification
       **Severity**: {P0 | P1 | P2 | P3 | TBD}
       **Category**: {availability | performance | functionality | security | data-integrity}

       ## Assigned Team
       **Incident Commander**: {TBD - to be assigned based on severity}
       **On-Call Engineer**: {TBD - from on-call rotation}
       **Status**: DETECTED

       Save to: .aiwg/incidents/{incident-id}/incident-record.md

       Also create initial timeline entry:
       | Time | Event | Actor | Notes |
       |------|-------|-------|-------|
       | {HH:MM UTC} | Incident detected | {reporter} | {initial symptoms} |

       Save to: .aiwg/incidents/{incident-id}/timeline.md
       """
   )
   ```

3. **Create Incident Communication Channel**:
   ```
   Task(
       subagent_type="incident-responder",
       description="Create incident alert and communication template",
       prompt="""
       Generate initial incident alert template:

       ## Incident Alert: {incident-id}

       **Status**: DETECTED
       **Severity**: {P0/P1/P2/P3}
       **Time**: {HH:MM UTC}

       **Issue**: {brief description}
       **User Impact**: {high-level impact}

       **Assigned**: {on-call engineer}
       **Next Update**: {estimated time}

       **Incident Channel**: #incident-{YYYY-MM-DD}-{ID}
       **Incident Dashboard**: {link to monitoring dashboard}

       Save to: .aiwg/incidents/{incident-id}/communications/initial-alert.md
       """
   )
   ```

**Communicate Progress**:
```
✓ Incident {incident-id} logged
✓ Initial record created
⏳ Proceeding to regression triage...
```

### Step 1.5: Regression Triage

**Purpose**: Determine if incident is a regression from recent changes to guide rollback decisions

**Your Actions**:

1. **Launch Regression Detection Agent**:
   ```
   Task(
       subagent_type="regression-analyst",
       description="Determine if incident is a regression from recent changes",
       prompt="""
       Read incident record: .aiwg/incidents/{incident-id}/incident-record.md

       Execute Regression Triage:

       ## Step 1: Identify Recent Deployments

       Check for recent deployments/changes:
       - Use command: /regression-check --baseline last-deployment
       - Review git log for last 24-48 hours
       - Check deployment history from CI/CD
       - Review configuration changes
       - Check infrastructure updates

       Document all recent changes with timestamps.

       ## Step 2: Symptom Correlation

       Compare incident symptoms against baseline:

       **Symptom Pattern Matching**:
       - Did this functionality work before? {YES | NO | UNKNOWN}
       - When did it last work? {timestamp | UNKNOWN}
       - What changed between working and broken? {specific change | UNKNOWN}

       **Regression Indicators** (Check all that apply):
       - [ ] Functionality worked in previous version
       - [ ] Issue appeared immediately after deployment
       - [ ] Issue correlates with specific commit/PR
       - [ ] Similar pattern in staging/canary deployment
       - [ ] Metrics show clear inflection point at deployment time

       ## Step 3: Regression Verdict

       **Is this a regression?**: {CONFIRMED | LIKELY | POSSIBLE | UNLIKELY | NOT_REGRESSION}

       **Confidence**: {HIGH (>90%) | MEDIUM (70-90%) | LOW (<70%)}

       **Evidence**:
       1. {evidence point 1}
       2. {evidence point 2}
       3. {evidence point 3}

       Save initial assessment to: .aiwg/incidents/{incident-id}/regression-analysis.md (Step 1-3)

       Append timeline:
       | {HH:MM UTC} | Regression triage initiated | regression-analyst | Verdict: {CONFIRMED|LIKELY|POSSIBLE|UNLIKELY|NOT_REGRESSION} |
       """
   )
   ```

2. **If Regression Confirmed/Likely, Launch Regression Bisect**:
   ```
   # Only if regression verdict is CONFIRMED or LIKELY
   Task(
       subagent_type="regression-analyst",
       description="Identify introducing change via bisect",
       prompt="""
       Read regression analysis: .aiwg/incidents/{incident-id}/regression-analysis.md

       Since regression is {CONFIRMED|LIKELY}, identify introducing change:

       ## Step 4: Bisect to Find Introducing Commit

       Use command: /regression-bisect

       Execute bisect process:
       - Start: {last-known-good-commit}
       - End: {current-broken-commit}
       - Test: {reproduction steps or test case}

       Document bisect process and result:

       **Bisect Results**:
       - **Introducing Commit**: {SHA}
       - **Author**: {name}
       - **Timestamp**: {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS}
       - **PR/MR**: {PR-number} - {PR-title}
       - **Commit Message**: {message}
       - **Files Changed**: {count} files
       - **Risk Assessment**: {LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH based on scope}

       **Commit Details**:
       ```
       {git show {SHA} --stat output}
       ```

       **Related Changes**:
       - [ ] Code changes in affected component
       - [ ] Configuration changes
       - [ ] Database migrations
       - [ ] Dependency updates
       - [ ] Infrastructure changes

       Append to: .aiwg/incidents/{incident-id}/regression-analysis.md (Step 4)

       Append timeline:
       | {HH:MM UTC} | Introducing commit identified | regression-analyst | Commit: {SHA}, PR: {PR-number} |
       """
   )
   ```

3. **Rollback Feasibility Assessment**:
   ```
   Task(
       subagent_type="reliability-engineer",
       description="Assess rollback feasibility and calculate blast radius",
       prompt="""
       Read regression analysis: .aiwg/incidents/{incident-id}/regression-analysis.md

       Since introducing change identified, assess rollback options:

       ## Step 5: Rollback Feasibility

       **Rollback Options**:

       ### Option A: Full Rollback to Previous Version
       - **Target Version**: {version before introducing commit}
       - **Feasibility**: {SAFE | RISKY | BLOCKED}
       - **Risk Factors**:
         - [ ] Database migrations in between (incompatible schema)
         - [ ] External API contract changes (breaking)
         - [ ] Data written in new format (can't be read by old version)
         - [ ] Dependent services already updated (coordination required)
       - **Rollback Time**: {estimated minutes}
       - **Data Loss Risk**: {NONE | MINIMAL | SIGNIFICANT}

       ### Option B: Revert Specific Commit(s)
       - **Commits to Revert**: {SHA1, SHA2, ...}
       - **Feasibility**: {SAFE | RISKY | BLOCKED}
       - **Conflicts**: {count} potential merge conflicts
       - **Testing Required**: {minimal | moderate | extensive}
       - **Revert + Deploy Time**: {estimated minutes}

       ### Option C: Feature Flag Disable
       - **Applicable**: {YES | NO}
       - **Feature Flags Involved**: {flag-names}
       - **Disable Time**: {estimated minutes} (near-instant)
       - **Partial Rollback**: {which features disabled}

       ### Option D: Hotfix Forward
       - **Feasibility**: {VIABLE | NOT_VIABLE}
       - **Fix Complexity**: {SIMPLE | MODERATE | COMPLEX}
       - **Estimated Fix Time**: {minutes}
       - **Testing Time**: {minutes}
       - **Total Time**: {minutes}

       **Recommended Option**: {A | B | C | D}
       **Rationale**: {why this option is best given constraints}

       ## Step 6: Blast Radius Calculation

       **Scope of Introducing Change**:
       - **Components Affected**: {list all components touched by change}
       - **Services Impacted**: {list all services}
       - **Dependencies**: {downstream systems affected}
       - **Users Impacted**: {estimated count or percentage}
       - **Geographic Scope**: {all regions | specific regions}
       - **User Segments**: {all users | specific segments}

       **Rollback Impact Assessment**:
       - **Services Affected by Rollback**: {list}
       - **Data Loss Risk**: {NONE | MINIMAL | ACCEPTABLE | UNACCEPTABLE}
       - **Downtime Required**: {NONE | <5 min | 5-15 min | >15 min}
       - **Coordination Required**: {list teams/services needing notification}

       **Blast Radius Score**: {LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH}

       Append to: .aiwg/incidents/{incident-id}/regression-analysis.md (Steps 5-6)

       Append timeline:
       | {HH:MM UTC} | Rollback feasibility assessed | reliability-engineer | Recommended: {option}, Blast radius: {score} |
       """
   )
   ```

4. **Immediate Action Recommendation**:
   ```
   Task(
       subagent_type="regression-analyst",
       description="Recommend immediate action based on regression analysis",
       prompt="""
       Read complete regression analysis: .aiwg/incidents/{incident-id}/regression-analysis.md

       ## Step 7: Immediate Action Decision Matrix

       Use decision matrix to recommend action:

       | Regression Confidence | Rollback Risk | User Impact | Recommendation |
       |-----------------------|---------------|-------------|----------------|
       | CONFIRMED + HIGH      | LOW           | HIGH        | **ROLLBACK IMMEDIATELY** |
       | CONFIRMED + HIGH      | LOW           | MEDIUM      | **ROLLBACK** |
       | CONFIRMED + HIGH      | MEDIUM        | HIGH        | **ROLLBACK with validation** |
       | CONFIRMED + HIGH      | HIGH          | HIGH        | **HOTFIX (rollback blocked)** |
       | LIKELY + MEDIUM       | LOW           | HIGH        | **ROLLBACK after quick validation** |
       | LIKELY + MEDIUM       | MEDIUM        | HIGH        | **INVESTIGATE + prepare rollback** |
       | POSSIBLE + LOW        | ANY           | HIGH        | **INVESTIGATE (parallel to Tier 1)** |
       | UNLIKELY              | ANY           | ANY         | **STANDARD TRIAGE (continue to Step 2)** |

       **Current Situation**:
       - Regression Confidence: {from Step 3}
       - Rollback Risk: {from Step 5}
       - User Impact: {from incident record}

       **Recommended Immediate Action**: {action from matrix}

       **Action Details**:
       - **Action Type**: {ROLLBACK | HOTFIX | INVESTIGATE | STANDARD_TRIAGE}
       - **Urgency**: {IMMEDIATE (<5 min) | URGENT (<15 min) | NORMAL (standard SLA)}
       - **Prerequisites**: {any validation or approval needed}
       - **Execution Steps**: {high-level steps}
       - **Fallback Plan**: {if this action fails}

       **Communication**:
       - Notify Incident Commander: {key finding summary}
       - Notify Deployment Manager: {rollback decision if applicable}
       - Update status: "Regression {CONFIRMED|LIKELY|POSSIBLE}, {action} in progress"

       Append to: .aiwg/incidents/{incident-id}/regression-analysis.md (Step 7)

       Append timeline:
       | {HH:MM UTC} | Immediate action recommended | regression-analyst | Action: {ROLLBACK|HOTFIX|INVESTIGATE|STANDARD_TRIAGE} |
       """
   )
   ```

5. **Update Regression Register**:
   ```
   Task(
       subagent_type="regression-analyst",
       description="Record regression in regression register",
       prompt="""
       If regression is CONFIRMED or LIKELY, update regression register:

       Read regression analysis: .aiwg/incidents/{incident-id}/regression-analysis.md

       Update regression register with incident:

       **Regression Entry**:
       ```yaml

         - {action 2 to improve detection}

       status: {OPEN | MITIGATED | ANALYZED | CLOSED}
       ```

       Save to: .aiwg/regression/register/{regression-id}.yaml

       Also update regression summary:
       Append one-line entry to: .aiwg/regression/regression-register-summary.md

       | {regression-id} | {incident-id} | {YYYY-MM-DD} | {P0|P1|P2} | {commit-SHA} | {category} | {status} |

       Cross-reference in incident:

**Decision Flow**:
```
Regression Triage Decision Tree:

1. Is this a regression?
   ├─ CONFIRMED/LIKELY → Proceed to rollback assessment
   │   ├─ Rollback SAFE + HIGH user impact → Execute rollback immediately
   │   ├─ Rollback RISKY or BLOCKED → Proceed to hotfix path
   │   └─ Rollback SAFE + LOW user impact → Prepare rollback, investigate in parallel
   │
   ├─ POSSIBLE → Continue standard triage in parallel with regression investigation
   │
   └─ UNLIKELY/NOT_REGRESSION → Continue to standard triage (Step 2)
```

**Communicate Progress**:
```
✓ Incident logged
⏳ Regression triage in progress...
  ✓ Recent deployments identified: {count} in last {hours}h
  ✓ Regression verdict: {CONFIRMED|LIKELY|POSSIBLE|UNLIKELY|NOT_REGRESSION}

### Step 2: Triage and Severity Assessment

**Purpose**: Rapidly assess severity and assign priority using Impact × Urgency matrix

**Your Actions**:

1. **Launch Triage Agents** (parallel):
   ```
   # Agent 1: Impact Assessment
   Task(
       subagent_type="incident-responder",
       description="Assess incident impact (user effect)",
       prompt="""
       Read incident record: .aiwg/incidents/{incident-id}/incident-record.md

       Assess Impact Level:

       **User Impact Assessment**:
       - Affected Users: {count or percentage}
       - Severity of Effect: {complete outage | severe degradation | minor issue}
       - Impact Level: {HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW}

       Criteria:
       - HIGH: Complete service outage OR >50% users affected OR data loss/corruption
       - MEDIUM: Severe degradation OR 10-50% users affected OR critical feature unavailable
       - LOW: Minor degradation OR <10% users affected OR cosmetic issue

       **Business Impact**:
       - Revenue Impact: {$amount | NONE}
       - Compliance Risk: {YES | NO}
       - Reputation Risk: {HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW}
       - User Safety Risk: {YES | NO}

       **Affected Systems**: {list all affected components, services, integrations}

       Save to: .aiwg/incidents/{incident-id}/triage-assessment.md (Impact section)
       """
   )

   # Agent 2: Urgency Assessment
   Task(
       subagent_type="reliability-engineer",
       description="Assess incident urgency (time sensitivity)",
       prompt="""
       Read incident record: .aiwg/incidents/{incident-id}/incident-record.md

       Assess Urgency Level:

       **Urgency Assessment**:
       - Time Sensitivity: {immediate | hours | days}
       - Worsening Trend: {rapidly degrading | stable | improving}
       - Urgency Level: {HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW}

       Criteria:
       - HIGH: Immediate resolution required, worsening rapidly, SLA breach imminent
       - MEDIUM: Resolution needed within hours, stable degradation
       - LOW: Resolution can be scheduled, no time pressure

       **SLA Breach Risk**:
       - Current Availability: {percentage}%
       - SLA Target: {percentage}%
       - Error Budget Remaining: {percentage}%
       - Time to SLA Breach: {estimated time}

       Append to: .aiwg/incidents/{incident-id}/triage-assessment.md (Urgency section)
       """
   )
   ```

2. **Synthesize Priority Classification**:
   ```
   Task(
       subagent_type="incident-responder",
       description="Determine incident priority from Impact × Urgency",
       prompt="""
       Read triage assessment: .aiwg/incidents/{incident-id}/triage-assessment.md

       Determine Priority using matrix:

       | Impact/Urgency | High Urgency | Medium Urgency | Low Urgency |
       |----------------|--------------|----------------|-------------|
       | High Impact    | P0 (Critical) | P1 (High)     | P2 (Medium) |

### Step 3: Functional Escalation (Tier 1 → Tier 2 → Tier 3)

**Purpose**: Engage appropriate expertise based on incident complexity

**Your Actions**:

1. **Tier 1 Response (First 15-30 minutes)**:
   ```
   Task(
       subagent_type="reliability-engineer",
       description="Tier 1 response: Runbook execution and data gathering",
       prompt="""
       Read incident record: .aiwg/incidents/{incident-id}/incident-record.md

       Execute Tier 1 Response:

       ## Initial Actions (First 5 minutes)
       - [ ] Acknowledge incident
       - [ ] Confirm user impact (reproduce if possible)
       - [ ] Check recent deployments/changes (last 24h)
       - [ ] Review monitoring dashboards for anomalies
       - [ ] Identify applicable runbook: deployment/runbook-{scenario}.md

       ## Data Gathering
       Collect diagnostic data:
       - System health (pods, nodes, services status)
       - Recent deployments (git log, rollout history)
       - Logs (last 500 lines from affected services)
       - Metrics (error rate, latency, throughput)
       - Database health (active connections, slow queries)

       Document actions taken and results.

       ## Escalation Decision (Tier 1 → Tier 2)
       Escalate if:
       - Runbook not available OR issue unresolved after {15 min P0 | 30 min P1}
       - Requires deep component knowledge or code changes
       - Database, network, or infrastructure issue suspected

       If escalation needed, document:
       - Why escalating (specific reason)
       - Data collected (attach logs, metrics)
       - Hypotheses tested (what was tried)

       Save diagnostic data to: .aiwg/incidents/{incident-id}/diagnostics/tier1-data.md

       Append timeline with all actions taken.
       """

       ## Handoff from Tier 1
       - Review incident summary and diagnostic data
       - Review actions already taken by Tier 1
       - Review relevant runbooks and recent changes

       ## Advanced Troubleshooting
       - Deep log analysis (error patterns, stack traces)
       - Code review for recent changes (git diff last 48h)
       - Reproduce issue in non-prod environment (if possible)
       - Check component dependencies (upstream/downstream services)
       - Analyze performance profiles (CPU, memory, query execution plans)

       ## Root Cause Hypothesis
       Formulate hypothesis:

       **Hypothesis**: {statement of suspected root cause}

       **Evidence**:
       1. {log pattern or metric anomaly}
       2. {recent deployment or config change}
       3. {external dependency status}

       **Test Plan**:
       - [ ] {validation step 1}
       - [ ] {validation step 2}

       ## Escalation Decision (Tier 2 → Tier 3)
       Escalate if:
       - Architectural issue or design flaw suspected
       - Vendor/third-party dependency issue
       - Unresolved after {30 min P0 | 1 hour P1}
       - Emergency code fix required (hotfix approval needed)

       - .aiwg/incidents/{incident-id}/diagnostics/tier1-data.md
       - .aiwg/incidents/{incident-id}/diagnostics/tier2-analysis.md

       Execute Tier 3 Response:

       ## Architectural Analysis
       - Review system design for fundamental issues
       - Evaluate scalability/capacity constraints
       - Consider architectural trade-offs (CAP theorem, consistency models)
       - Engage vendor support if third-party dependency issue

       ## Emergency Decision Authority
       Provide decisions on:
       - Emergency architecture changes (approve/reject)
       - Vendor escalation (initiate if needed)
       - Hotfix deployment outside normal process (approve with conditions)

2. **Executive Escalation (P0 Critical)**:
   ```
   Task(
       subagent_type="project-manager",
       description="Notify executive leadership for P0 or major business impact",
       prompt="""
       Read incident record: .aiwg/incidents/{incident-id}/incident-record.md

       Determine if executive notification required:

       **Trigger**:
       - P0: If unresolved after 2 hours OR major business impact
       - Security breach or data loss (immediate)
       - Public/media attention likely
       - Regulatory reporting required

       Generate executive notification:

       Subject: [EXECUTIVE ALERT] P0 Incident - {brief-title}

       **Business Impact Summary**:

### Step 5: Root Cause Analysis

**Purpose**: Identify root cause using structured methodologies (5 Whys, Fishbone)

**Your Actions**:

1. **Launch RCA Agents** (parallel):
   ```
   # Agent 1: 5 Whys Analysis
   Task(
       subagent_type="incident-responder",
       description="Conduct 5 Whys root cause analysis",
       prompt="""

       - .aiwg/incidents/{incident-id}/diagnostics/tier3-architecture-assessment.md (if exists)

       Conduct 5 Whys Analysis:

       **Problem Statement**: {what happened}

       1. **Why did {problem} occur?**
          - Because {reason-1}

       2. **Why did {reason-1} occur?**

       **Root Cause**: {final answer from 5th why}

       **Validation**: {test to confirm root cause}

       Save to: .aiwg/incidents/{incident-id}/root-cause-analysis.md (5 Whys section)
       """
   )

   # Agent 2: Contributing Factors (Fishbone)
   Task(
       subagent_type="reliability-engineer",
       description="Identify contributing factors using Ishikawa diagram",
       prompt="""
       Read diagnostics and 5 Whys analysis

       Analyze Contributing Factors:

       **Problem**: {incident title}

       ### People
       - {factor 1: e.g., insufficient training}
       - {factor 2: e.g., on-call fatigue}

       ### Process
       - {factor 1: e.g., inadequate testing}
       - {factor 2: e.g., unclear runbook}

       ### Technology
       - {factor 1: e.g., database connection pool exhaustion}
       - {factor 2: e.g., monitoring gap}

       ### Environment
       - {factor 1: e.g., traffic spike}
       - {factor 2: e.g., resource constraints}

       **Primary Root Cause**: {from 5 Whys}
       **Contributing Factors**: {list key factors from above}

       Append to: .aiwg/incidents/{incident-id}/root-cause-analysis.md (Contributing Factors section)

### Step 6: Mitigation and Resolution

**Purpose**: Implement workaround or fix to restore service and eliminate user impact

**Your Actions**:

1. **Select Mitigation Strategy**:
   ```
   Task(
       subagent_type="incident-responder",
       description="Select mitigation strategy based on root cause",
       prompt="""
       Read root cause analysis: .aiwg/incidents/{incident-id}/root-cause-analysis.md

       Evaluate Mitigation Options:

       **Option 1: Rollback** (fastest, safest for deployment-related incidents)
       - Use Case: Recent deployment caused issue, old version was stable
       - Time to Mitigate: 5-15 minutes
       - Risk: Low (return to known-good state)

       **Option 2: Hotfix** (targeted code fix)
       - Use Case: Bug fix required, rollback not viable
       - Time to Mitigate: 30 minutes - 2 hours
       - Risk: Medium (new code, limited testing)

       **Option 3: Configuration Change** (parameter adjustment)
       - Use Case: Resource limits, timeouts, feature flags
       - Time to Mitigate: 10-30 minutes
       - Risk: Low-Medium (no code change)

       **Option 4: Workaround** (temporary user-side solution)
       - Use Case: Fix requires significant time, need immediate relief
       - Time to Mitigate: Immediate (communication)
       - Risk: Low (no system change)

       **Option 5: Infrastructure Scaling** (resource addition)
       - Use Case: Capacity issue, traffic spike
       - Time to Mitigate: 10-20 minutes
       - Risk: Low-Medium (cost implications)

       **Selected Strategy**: {option}
       **Rationale**: {why this option was chosen}
       **Implementation Plan**: {specific steps}
       **Rollback Plan**: {if mitigation fails, how to revert}

## Error Handling

**If Incident Not Resolving Within SLA**:
```
⚠️ Incident exceeds resolution SLA ({P0 >2h | P1 >4h})

Current status: {INVESTIGATING | MITIGATING}
Elapsed time: {HH:MM}

Actions:
1. Escalating to Incident Commander (if not already involved)
2. Assembling war room with all Component Owners
3. Considering emergency measures:
   - Rollback to last known-good version
   - Enable maintenance mode (planned downtime)
   - Engage vendor support (if third-party dependency)
4. Updating stakeholders every {15|30} minutes
5. Notifying {executive sponsor | management}

Escalation contact: {Incident Commander → Engineering Manager → VP Engineering → CTO}
```

**If Escalation Path Blocked**:
```
⚠️ Key person unavailable: {Tier 2/3 owner | Incident Commander}

Actions:
1. Checking on-call rotation for backup/secondary contact
2. Escalating to engineering manager for alternate assignment
3. Engaging Software Architect for temporary coverage (if Component Owner unavailable)
4. Documenting unavailability in incident timeline

Backup contacts:
- Tier 2 Backup: {name, contact}
- Tier 3 Backup: {name, contact}
- Incident Commander Backup: {name, contact}
```

**If Multiple Concurrent Incidents (Major Incident)**:
```
⚠️ Multiple concurrent incidents detected: {count} P0/P1 incidents

Declaring MAJOR INCIDENT status.

Actions:
1. Assigning separate Incident Commander for each incident
2. Establishing central coordination (Senior Incident Commander)
3. Triaging incidents by business impact priority
4. Allocating resources (may pull from non-critical work)
5. Executive notification immediate
6. Status page update: "Multiple service disruptions"

Considerations:
- Implementing change freeze (halt all deployments)
- Scaling back non-essential services to free resources
- Engaging vendor support across all affected systems

Major Incident Coordinator: {Senior Engineering Manager or VP Engineering}
```

**If Rollback Fails (CRITICAL)**:
```
❌ Rollback did not resolve incident or rollback itself failed

STOP: No further changes until assessment complete.

Escalating to P0 CRITICAL.

Assembling emergency war room:
- Incident Commander
- Deployment Manager
- Software Architect
- Database Administrator (if data issue)
- Infrastructure Lead

Options under evaluation:
- Rollback to earlier version (skip problematic release)
- Emergency hotfix (if root cause clear)
- Maintenance mode (planned downtime for investigation)
- Manual intervention (database repair, data migration)

Executive notification: IMMEDIATE
Public communication: "Extended outage, team working on resolution"

Emergency contact: {CTO or VP Engineering}
```

**If Security Breach or Data Loss**:
```
❌ SECURITY INCIDENT or DATA LOSS detected

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
1. Engaging Security Gatekeeper and Security Incident Response Team
2. Preserving evidence (logs, forensics) before mitigation
3. Isolating affected systems
4. Following Security Incident Response Plan (separate from standard flow)

Notifications:
- Legal and compliance: IMMEDIATE
- Executive: IMMEDIATE
- Regulatory reporting: {GDPR, HIPAA, etc.} within required timeframes
- User notification: Per breach disclosure laws

Forensic analysis required before system restoration.

Security Incident Lead: {Security Gatekeeper or CISO}
Legal Contact: {General Counsel}

Extended PIR with security-specific preventive actions required.
```
