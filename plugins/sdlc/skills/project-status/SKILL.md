# Project Status

## Task

Analyze `.aiwg/` artifacts to determine project state and provide actionable status report with phase-appropriate next commands.

When invoked with `/project-status [project-directory]`:

1. **Scan** `.aiwg/` directory for artifacts
2. **Detect** current SDLC phase and workflow state
3. **Analyze** completion of phase milestones
4. **Identify** blockers and gaps
5. **Recommend** next commands based on current state

## Parameters

- **`[project-directory]`** (optional): Path to project root (default: current directory `.`)

## Inputs

Scans `.aiwg/` directory for:
- **Intake**: `intake/project-intake.md`, `solution-profile.md`, `option-matrix.md`
- **Planning**: `planning/phase-plan-*.md`, `planning/iteration-plan-*.md`
- **Requirements**: `requirements/*.md`
- **Architecture**: `architecture/SAD.md`, `architecture/ADR-*.md`
- **Risks**: `risks/risk-list.md`
- **Testing**: `testing/test-*.md`
- **Security**: `security/threat-model.md`, `security/security-*.md`
- **Quality**: `quality/code-review-*.md`, `quality/retrospective-*.md`
- **Deployment**: `deployment/deployment-plan.md`
- **Gates**: `gates/gate-*.md`
- **Handoffs**: `handoffs/handoff-*.md`
- **Decisions**: `decisions/change-*.md`
- **Team**: `team/team-profile.yaml`, `team/agent-assignments.md`

## Outputs

**Console output**: Formatted status report with phase detection, milestone progress, blockers, and recommended next steps.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Discover .aiwg/ Structure

```bash
# Check if .aiwg/ exists
ls .aiwg/ 2>/dev/null

# If not found, check for legacy intake/ directory
ls intake/ 2>/dev/null
```

**Decision**:
- If `.aiwg/` exists → proceed with analysis
- If only `intake/` exists → warn about legacy location, proceed with limited analysis
- If neither exists → report "No SDLC artifacts found. Run `/intake-wizard` to start."

### Step 2: Detect Current Phase

**Phase Detection Logic** (priority order):

1. **Pre-Inception** (No intake):
   - Condition: No `.aiwg/intake/` directory OR intake files missing
   - Status: "Project not started"
   - Next: Choose ONE intake method:
     - `/intake-wizard` (interactive generation)
     - `/intake-from-codebase` (analyze existing code)
     - `/intake-start` (enhance user-provided intake files)

2. **Inception** (Intake complete, no phase plan):
   - Condition: Intake files present + NO `planning/phase-plan-inception.md`
   - Status: "Intake complete, ready for Inception"
   - Next: `/flow-concept-to-inception`

3. **Inception Active** (Phase plan exists, not complete):
   - Condition: `planning/phase-plan-inception.md` exists + NO `gates/gate-inception.md` OR gate status ≠ PASSED
   - Status: "Inception phase active"
   - Next: Continue Inception activities, complete gate check

4. **Elaboration** (Inception gate passed, elaboration active):
   - Condition: `gates/gate-inception.md` PASSED + `planning/phase-plan-elaboration.md` exists
   - Status: "Elaboration phase active"
   - Next: Architecture baseline, risk retirement, iteration planning

5. **Construction** (Elaboration gate passed, construction active):
   - Condition: `gates/gate-elaboration.md` PASSED + `planning/iteration-plan-*.csv` exists
   - Status: "Construction phase active (Iteration N)"
   - Next: Feature delivery, testing, iteration assessments

6. **Transition** (Construction complete, deployment prep):
   - Condition: `gates/gate-construction.md` PASSED + `deployment/deployment-plan.md` exists
   - Status: "Transition phase active"
   - Next: Deployment, training, hypercare monitoring

7. **Production** (Deployed):
   - Condition: `deployment/production-deployment-*.md` exists with "Status: Deployed"
   - Status: "In production"
   - Next: Monitoring, incident response, continuous improvement

### Step 5: Recommend Next Commands

Based on phase and state, recommend **3-5 most relevant commands**:

#### Pre-Inception → Intake Complete

```markdown
**Recommended Next Steps**:

Choose ONE intake method:

1. **Generate intake interactively** (recommended for new projects):
   - `/intake-wizard "your project description"`
   - Or complete partial intake: `/intake-wizard --complete --interactive`

2. **Generate intake from codebase** (for existing projects):
   - `/intake-from-codebase .`

3. **Enhance user-provided intake files** (if you manually created intake docs):
   - `/intake-start .aiwg/intake/`
```

#### Intake Complete → Inception Active

```markdown
**Recommended Next Steps**:

1. **Begin Concept → Inception flow**:
   - `/flow-concept-to-inception`
   - Natural language: "Start Inception" or "Let's begin Inception phase"

2. **Initiate risk management**:
   - `/flow-risk-management-cycle`

3. **Document architecture decisions** (if not done):
   - Manually create `architecture/ADR-001-<decision>.md`
```

#### Inception Active → Elaboration

```markdown
**Recommended Next Steps**:

1. **Check Inception gate readiness**:
   - `/flow-gate-check inception`

2. **If gate passed, transition to Elaboration**:
   - `/flow-inception-to-elaboration .aiwg/`

3. **Blockers** (if gate not ready):
   - {list missing artifacts}
   - {list open HIGH risks}
   - {list pending decisions}
```

#### Elaboration Active → Construction

```markdown
**Recommended Next Steps**:

1. **Build architectural baseline**:
   - `/build-poc <feature-or-risk>` (for risky architecture)
   - Manually create `architecture/SAD.md` and `architecture/executable-prototype.md`

2. **Evolve architecture**:
   - `/flow-architecture-evolution <trigger>`

3. **Retire risks**:
   - `/flow-risk-management-cycle .aiwg/`

4. **Define test strategy**:
   - `/flow-test-strategy-execution <test-level>`

5. **Check Elaboration gate readiness**:
   - `/flow-gate-check elaboration`

6. **If gate passed, transition to Construction**:
   - `/flow-elaboration-to-construction .aiwg/`
```

#### Construction Active (Iterations)

```markdown
**Recommended Next Steps**:

1. **Run dual-track iteration** (recommended):
   - `/flow-iteration-dual-track <iteration-number>`

2. **Or separate Discovery and Delivery**:
   - `/flow-discovery-track <iteration-number+1>` (plan ahead)
   - `/flow-delivery-track <iteration-number>` (deliver current)

3. **Execute test strategy**:
   - `/flow-test-strategy-execution <test-level> <component>`

4. **Manage evolving requirements**:
   - `/flow-requirements-evolution .aiwg/ --iteration <N>`

5. **Review security**:
   - `/flow-security-review-cycle .aiwg/ --iteration <N>`

6. **Conduct retrospective** (end of iteration):
   - `/flow-retrospective-cycle iteration <iteration-number>`

7. **Check Construction gate readiness** (when feature complete):
   - `/flow-gate-check construction`
```

#### Construction → Transition

```markdown
**Recommended Next Steps**:

1. **Validate Construction gate**:
   - `/flow-gate-check construction`

2. **If gate passed, transition to Transition**:
   - `/flow-construction-to-transition .aiwg/`

3. **Blockers** (if gate not ready):
   - {list failing tests}
   - {list coverage gaps}
   - {list open defects}
```

#### Transition Active → Production

```markdown
**Recommended Next Steps**:

1. **Deploy to production**:
   - `/flow-deploy-to-production <blue-green|canary> <version>`

2. **Validate handoffs**:
   - `/flow-handoff-checklist Construction Transition`

3. **Initiate hypercare monitoring**:
   - `/flow-hypercare-monitoring <duration-days>`

4. **Check Transition gate readiness**:
   - `/flow-gate-check transition`
```

#### Production (Ongoing)

```markdown
**Recommended Next Steps**:

1. **Monitor health**:
   - `/project-health-check`

2. **Respond to incidents** (if issues):
   - `/flow-incident-response <incident-id> <severity>`

3. **Optimize performance** (if degradation):
   - `/flow-performance-optimization <trigger> <component>`

4. **Validate compliance** (periodic):
   - `/flow-compliance-validation <framework>`

5. **Onboard new team members** (if team growing):
   - `/flow-team-onboarding <name> <role>`

6. **Conduct retrospective** (periodic):
   - `/flow-retrospective-cycle release <version>`
```

### Step 6: Generate Status Report

## Error Handling

### No .aiwg/ Directory

```markdown
# Project Status Report

**Status**: ❌ No SDLC artifacts found

The `.aiwg/` directory does not exist in this project.

**Recommended Next Steps**:

1. **Start a new SDLC project**:
   ```bash
   /intake-wizard "your project description"
   ```

2. **Analyze existing codebase**:
   ```bash
   /intake-from-codebase .
   ```

3. **Learn more**:
   - See SDLC framework documentation: `agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/README.md`
   - See phase workflows: `agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/plan-act-sdlc.md`
```

### Corrupted or Incomplete Artifacts

If artifacts exist but are malformed:
- **WARN**: "Found {artifact} but could not parse. May be incomplete or corrupted."
- **Recommendation**: "Review {artifact} manually or regenerate using {command}."

### Conflicting State

If artifacts indicate conflicting states (e.g., Elaboration gate PASSED but no Construction artifacts):
- **WARN**: "Conflicting state detected. Gate passed but next phase not started."
- **Recommendation**: "Run `/flow-{phase}-to-{next-phase}` to transition."

## Best Practices

1. **Run frequently**: Use `/project-status` at start of each work session to orient
2. **After major milestones**: Check status after completing gate checks or phase transitions
3. **When stuck**: If unsure what to do next, check status for recommendations
4. **Team coordination**: Share status report with team to align on current state
5. **Progress tracking**: Compare status reports over time to measure velocity

## Success Criteria

This command succeeds when:
- [ ] `.aiwg/` directory scanned successfully
- [ ] Current phase detected accurately
- [ ] Milestone progress calculated
- [ ] Blockers identified (if any)
- [ ] Next steps recommended (3-5 relevant commands)
- [ ] Status report formatted and output to console
