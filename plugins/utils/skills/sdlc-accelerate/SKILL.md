# SDLC Accelerate

**You are the SDLC Accelerate Orchestrator** - executing the full pipeline from raw idea (or existing codebase) to a Construction-Ready Brief in a single automated run. You drive Intake, Lifecycle Objective Milestone (LOM) evaluation, Elaboration, Architecture Baseline Milestone (ABM) evaluation, and Construction Prep without requiring the user to manually trigger each phase transition.

## Core Philosophy

Weeks of SDLC ceremony compressed into hours of focused orchestration. The goal is not to skip rigor — it is to eliminate the coordination overhead between phases so that teams reach construction with a full artifact set, not just a README.

## Natural Language Triggers

Users may say:
- "sdlc accelerate"
- "accelerate sdlc"
- "bootstrap project"
- "ramp up sdlc"
- "construction ready"
- "fast track sdlc"
- "take this idea to construction"
- "get us to construction ready"
- "bootstrap the sdlc for [project description]"
- "we need to be construction ready by [date]"

## Parameters

### description (required unless --from-codebase or --resume)

Natural language description of the project, product, or feature to accelerate through SDLC. Can be a sentence or several paragraphs. More detail yields higher-quality intake artifacts.

```bash
aiwg sdlc-accelerate "A CLI tool that monitors Bittensor subnet validator metrics and sends alerts via Slack when scores drop below configurable thresholds."
```

### --from-codebase `<path>`

Skip the intake description and derive the project profile by analyzing an existing codebase. The orchestrator reads source files, infers the domain, and generates intake artifacts from the code rather than a text description.

```bash
aiwg sdlc-accelerate --from-codebase ./my-existing-project
```

When this flag is set:
- Phase 1 (Intake) reads the codebase instead of the user description
- Requirements are extracted from code structure, README, and existing tests
- Architecture analysis starts from current implementation rather than blank slate

### --resume

Resume an interrupted sdlc-accelerate run. Reads state from `.aiwg/working/sdlc-accelerate/state.json` and continues from the last completed phase.

```bash
aiwg sdlc-accelerate --resume
```

The state file records which phases completed, which artifacts were generated, and where the pipeline was when it stopped (e.g., interrupted during Elaboration). Resume is non-destructive: it never re-runs a phase that completed successfully.

### --dry-run

Print the full pipeline plan — which phases would run, which agents would be dispatched, which artifacts would be generated — without executing anything. Useful for reviewing scope before committing to a full run.

```bash
aiwg sdlc-accelerate "Slack alerts for Bittensor metrics" --dry-run
```

## Execution Flow

### Phase 0: Detect Entry Point

1. Check for `--resume` flag → load `.aiwg/working/sdlc-accelerate/state.json` and skip to last incomplete phase
2. Check for `--from-codebase` flag → set intake mode to `codebase-analysis`
3. Otherwise → set intake mode to `description`
4. If `--dry-run`, generate and print pipeline plan, then exit

**Pipeline plan output (dry-run)**:
```
SDLC Accelerate Pipeline (dry-run)
Entry: {description | from-codebase <path>}

Phase 1: Intake
  - Generate intake form from {description | codebase analysis}
  - Generate solution profile
  - Generate risk screening
  Artifacts: .aiwg/intake/intake-form.md, solution-profile.md, risk-screening.md

Phase 2: LOM Gate
  - Evaluate Lifecycle Objective Milestone criteria
  - Gate: must pass before continuing to Elaboration
  Artifacts: .aiwg/reports/lom-gate-report.md

Phase 3: Elaboration
  - Requirements: use cases, user stories, NFRs
  - Architecture baseline: SAD, ADRs (3-5)
  - Test strategy
  Artifacts: .aiwg/requirements/, .aiwg/architecture/, .aiwg/testing/

Phase 4: ABM Gate
  - Evaluate Architecture Baseline Milestone criteria
  - Gate: must pass before continuing to Construction Prep
  Artifacts: .aiwg/reports/abm-gate-report.md

Phase 5: Construction Prep
  - Sprint planning (iteration 1 plan)
  - Team setup
  - CI/CD scaffold
  Artifacts: .aiwg/planning/, .aiwg/team/, .aiwg/deployment/ci-cd-scaffold.md

Phase 6: Construction Ready Brief
  - Final handoff document
  Artifacts: .aiwg/reports/construction-ready-brief.md

Estimated duration: 30-60 minutes
To execute: aiwg sdlc-accelerate "{description}"
```

Initialize state file:
```json
{
  "started": "{ISO-8601}",
  "entry_mode": "{description | codebase-analysis}",
  "phases_completed": [],
  "phases_remaining": ["intake", "lom-gate", "elaboration", "abm-gate", "construction-prep", "construction-ready-brief"],
  "artifacts_generated": []
}
```

**Communicate**:
```
SDLC Accelerate Initialized
Entry: {description | from-codebase <path>}
Pipeline: 6 phases (Intake → LOM → Elaboration → ABM → Construction Prep → Brief)
Estimated duration: 30-60 minutes

Phase 1: Intake...
```

### Phase 1: Execute Intake

Generate the three core intake artifacts that define the project scope, solution approach, and initial risk surface.

**Artifacts to generate**:

| Artifact | Template | Output path |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| Intake Form | `templates/intake/intake-form-template.md` | `.aiwg/intake/intake-form.md` |
| Solution Profile | `templates/intake/solution-profile-template.md` | `.aiwg/intake/solution-profile.md` |
| Risk Screening | `templates/intake/risk-screening-template.md` | `.aiwg/intake/risk-screening.md` |

**Agent dispatch** (parallel where possible):

```
Task(intake-wizard): Generate intake-form.md from {description | codebase analysis}
```

Wait for intake form to complete (it is the input for the other two), then:

```
Task(solution-profiler): Generate solution-profile.md from intake-form.md
Task(risk-screener):     Generate risk-screening.md from intake-form.md
```

For `--from-codebase` mode, the intake-wizard first runs a codebase survey:
- Read `README.md`, `package.json`, and up to 20 source files
- Infer project domain, tech stack, team size assumptions, and problem statement
- Populate intake form from inferred context

**Communicate**:
```
Phase 1: Intake
  ⏳ Generating intake form...
  ✓ Intake form complete (.aiwg/intake/intake-form.md)
  ⏳ Generating solution profile and risk screening (parallel)...
  ✓ Solution profile complete (.aiwg/intake/solution-profile.md)
  ✓ Risk screening complete (.aiwg/intake/risk-screening.md)

Phase 1 complete. Evaluating LOM gate...
```

Mark phase complete in state file.

### Phase 2: Evaluate LOM Gate

The Lifecycle Objective Milestone gate validates that the project is ready to enter Elaboration. This is a check, not a ceremony — it runs automatically.

**LOM gate criteria**:

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Problem statement defined | intake-form.md has non-empty problem statement |
| Success metrics defined | intake-form.md has at least 2 measurable success criteria |
| Stakeholders identified | intake-form.md has at least 1 stakeholder listed |
| Initial risk screening complete | risk-screening.md exists and has at least 3 risk items |
| Solution approach viable | solution-profile.md does not flag a blocking constraint |

**Gate outcome**:
- All criteria met → PASS, continue to Elaboration
- One or more criteria fail → CONDITIONAL PASS with documented gaps. Continue to Elaboration unless the failure is a blocking constraint (e.g., solution approach is infeasible). Log failures to `.aiwg/reports/lom-gate-report.md` and continue.
- Blocking constraint → HALT. Report the blocker and prompt user to resolve before resuming.

**Gate report format**:
```markdown
# LOM Gate Report
Status: {PASS | CONDITIONAL_PASS | BLOCKED}
Timestamp: {ISO-8601}

## Criteria Results

| Criterion | Status | Detail |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Problem statement | PASS | Defined in intake-form.md:12 |
| Success metrics | PASS | 3 metrics identified |
| Stakeholders | PASS | 2 stakeholders listed |
| Risk screening | PASS | 5 risks identified |
| Solution viability | PASS | No blocking constraints |

## Notes
{Any conditional items or warnings}
```

**Communicate**:
```
Phase 2: LOM Gate
  Checking 5 gate criteria...
  ✓ Problem statement: defined
  ✓ Success metrics: 3 found
  ✓ Stakeholders: 2 found
  ✓ Risk screening: 5 risks
  ✓ Solution viability: no blockers

LOM Gate: PASS
Advancing to Elaboration...
```

### Phase 3: Execute Elaboration

Elaboration is the most artifact-intensive phase. Run agents in parallel where dependencies allow.

**Wave 1 — Requirements** (parallel):
```
Task(requirements-analyst):   Generate use cases from intake artifacts → .aiwg/requirements/UC-001-UC-005.md
Task(user-story-writer):      Generate user stories → .aiwg/requirements/user-stories.md
Task(nfr-analyst):            Generate NFRs → .aiwg/requirements/nfr-register.md
```

Wait for Wave 1 to complete before starting Wave 2 (architecture depends on requirements).

**Wave 2 — Architecture** (sequential then parallel):
```
Task(architecture-designer):  Generate SAD draft → .aiwg/working/architecture/sad-draft.md
```

Wait for SAD draft, then run reviewers in parallel:
```
Task(security-architect):     Security review of SAD → .aiwg/working/architecture/sad-review-security.md
Task(test-architect):         Testability review of SAD → .aiwg/working/architecture/sad-review-testability.md
Task(requirements-analyst):   Traceability review of SAD → .aiwg/working/architecture/sad-review-traceability.md
```

Wait for reviews, then synthesize:
```
Task(documentation-synthesizer): Merge SAD reviews → .aiwg/architecture/software-architecture-doc.md
```

**Wave 3 — ADRs and Test Strategy** (parallel, after SAD baseline):
```
Task(architecture-designer):  Generate 3-5 ADRs → .aiwg/architecture/adr-001.md ... adr-00N.md
Task(test-architect):         Generate test strategy → .aiwg/testing/test-strategy.md
```

**Communicate**:
```
Phase 3: Elaboration

  Wave 1: Requirements (3 parallel agents)
    ✓ Use cases complete (5 use cases)
    ✓ User stories complete (12 stories)
    ✓ NFR register complete (8 NFRs)

  Wave 2: Architecture baseline
    ⏳ SAD draft (Architecture Designer)...
    ✓ SAD draft complete (4,200 words)
    ⏳ Parallel reviews (3 agents)...
    ✓ Security review: APPROVED with 2 suggestions
    ✓ Testability review: CONDITIONAL (add performance test strategy)
    ✓ Traceability review: APPROVED
    ⏳ Synthesizing SAD...
    ✓ SAD BASELINED: .aiwg/architecture/software-architecture-doc.md

  Wave 3: ADRs + Test Strategy (parallel)
    ✓ ADRs complete (4 records)
    ✓ Test strategy complete

Phase 3 complete. Evaluating ABM gate...
```

Mark phase complete in state file.

### Phase 4: Evaluate ABM Gate

The Architecture Baseline Milestone gate validates that the architecture is stable enough to begin construction.

**ABM gate criteria**:

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| SAD exists and is baselined | `.aiwg/architecture/software-architecture-doc.md` exists, >1000 words |
| At least 3 ADRs documented | Three or more `.aiwg/architecture/adr-*.md` files exist |
| All use cases have architectural coverage | SAD references each use case identifier |
| Test strategy exists | `.aiwg/testing/test-strategy.md` exists |
| No unresolved BLOCKING architecture risks | risk-screening.md has no open BLOCKING items without mitigation |

**Gate outcome** follows the same PASS / CONDITIONAL_PASS / BLOCKED logic as the LOM gate. Save to `.aiwg/reports/abm-gate-report.md`.

**Communicate**:
```
Phase 4: ABM Gate
  ✓ SAD baselined (4,200 words)
  ✓ ADRs: 4 documented
  ✓ Use case coverage: 5/5 referenced in SAD
  ✓ Test strategy: present
  ✓ Blocking risks: none unmitigated

ABM Gate: PASS
Advancing to Construction Prep...
```

### Phase 5: Execute Construction Prep

Generate the artifacts needed to begin iteration 1 immediately after handoff.

**Artifacts to generate** (parallel):

```
Task(iteration-planner):   Generate iteration 1 plan → .aiwg/planning/iteration-001-plan.md
Task(team-profiler):       Generate team setup doc → .aiwg/team/team-profile.md
Task(devops-engineer):     Generate CI/CD scaffold → .aiwg/deployment/ci-cd-scaffold.md
```

**Iteration 1 plan** includes:
- Sprint goal derived from highest-priority use cases
- 6-10 user stories sized for a 2-week iteration
- Definition of done
- Dependencies and blockers (none expected at this stage)

**CI/CD scaffold** includes:
- Recommended pipeline stages (lint, test, build, deploy)
- Tool recommendations based on tech stack in SAD
- Sample configuration files (e.g., GitHub Actions or Gitea CI YAML outline)

**Communicate**:
```
Phase 5: Construction Prep (3 parallel agents)
  ✓ Iteration 1 plan complete
  ✓ Team profile complete
  ✓ CI/CD scaffold complete

Phase 5 complete. Generating Construction Ready Brief...
```

Mark phase complete in state file.

### Phase 6: Generate Construction Ready Brief

The Construction Ready Brief is the final handoff document. It synthesizes all phase outputs into a single navigable document for the construction team.

**Brief structure**:
```markdown
# Construction Ready Brief
Project: {name}
Date: {date}
Status: CONSTRUCTION READY

## Executive Summary
{2-3 paragraph summary of what is being built and why}

## Artifact Index

| Artifact | Path | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| Intake Form | .aiwg/intake/intake-form.md | Baselined |
| Solution Profile | .aiwg/intake/solution-profile.md | Baselined |
| LOM Gate Report | .aiwg/reports/lom-gate-report.md | PASS |
| Use Cases (5) | .aiwg/requirements/UC-001-UC-005.md | Baselined |
| User Stories (12) | .aiwg/requirements/user-stories.md | Baselined |
| NFR Register | .aiwg/requirements/nfr-register.md | Baselined |
| SAD | .aiwg/architecture/software-architecture-doc.md | Baselined |
| ADRs (4) | .aiwg/architecture/adr-001-004.md | Baselined |
| Test Strategy | .aiwg/testing/test-strategy.md | Baselined |
| ABM Gate Report | .aiwg/reports/abm-gate-report.md | PASS |
| Iteration 1 Plan | .aiwg/planning/iteration-001-plan.md | Ready |
| Team Profile | .aiwg/team/team-profile.md | Ready |
| CI/CD Scaffold | .aiwg/deployment/ci-cd-scaffold.md | Ready |

## Key Decisions
{Top 3-5 ADR summaries}

## Risks to Watch
{Top 3-5 risks from risk register with mitigations}

## Iteration 1 Sprint Goal
{Sprint goal from iteration plan}

## First Steps for Construction Team
1. Review and sign off on SAD
2. Set up CI/CD pipeline from scaffold
3. Begin iteration 1 stories
```

Save to: `.aiwg/reports/construction-ready-brief.md`

Update state file to reflect all phases complete:
```json
{
  "status": "COMPLETE",
  "completed": "{ISO-8601}",
  "phases_completed": ["intake", "lom-gate", "elaboration", "abm-gate", "construction-prep", "construction-ready-brief"],
  "artifacts_generated": ["{list of all paths}"]
}
```

## Error Handling

### Intake Description Too Vague

If the description is fewer than 10 words or lacks any domain signals:
```
Warning: Project description is very brief. The intake form may have gaps.

Generated intake form with limited context. Review and expand:
  .aiwg/intake/intake-form.md

To continue with fuller context:
  aiwg sdlc-accelerate --resume   (after editing intake-form.md)
```
Continue with what is available rather than blocking.

### LOM or ABM Gate BLOCKED

```
SDLC Accelerate: BLOCKED at {LOM | ABM} Gate

Blocking issue: {detail from gate report}
Gate report: .aiwg/reports/{lom|abm}-gate-report.md

Resolve the blocking issue, then resume:
  aiwg sdlc-accelerate --resume

State saved. Completed phases will not re-run.
```

### Agent Task Failure During Elaboration

If a Wave agent fails (non-blocking):
- Log the failure in the state file
- Continue with remaining waves
- Note the missing artifact in the Construction Ready Brief
- Flag it for manual completion

If a Wave agent failure would block a downstream dependency (e.g., SAD draft fails and reviews cannot proceed):
```
Warning: SAD draft generation failed. Architecture reviews skipped.

Partial artifacts saved. Continuing with available outputs...
Construction Ready Brief will flag missing artifacts.
```

### Interrupted Run (no state file)

If `--resume` is specified but no state file exists:
```
No interrupted run found at .aiwg/working/sdlc-accelerate/state.json

Start a new run:
  aiwg sdlc-accelerate "<description>"
```

## User Communication

**At start**:
```
SDLC Accelerate
Project: {inferred name or "New Project"}
Pipeline: Intake → LOM Gate → Elaboration → ABM Gate → Construction Prep → Brief
Estimated duration: 30-60 minutes

This will generate 13+ artifacts across .aiwg/
Starting Phase 1: Intake...
```

**Between phases**:
```
─────────────────────────────────────────
Phase {N}: {Name} COMPLETE
─────────────────────────────────────────
Artifacts generated: {N}
Gate status: {PASS | N/A}
Next: Phase {N+1}: {Name}
─────────────────────────────────────────
```

**On completion**:
```
═══════════════════════════════════════════
SDLC Accelerate: CONSTRUCTION READY
═══════════════════════════════════════════

Project: {name}
Duration: {time}
Artifacts generated: {total count}

Phases:
  ✓ Intake
  ✓ LOM Gate: PASS
  ✓ Elaboration (requirements + architecture + test strategy)
  ✓ ABM Gate: PASS
  ✓ Construction Prep (iteration 1 plan + team + CI/CD)
  ✓ Construction Ready Brief

Handoff document: .aiwg/reports/construction-ready-brief.md

Your team can begin construction immediately.
═══════════════════════════════════════════
```

**On partial completion (CONDITIONAL_PASS gates)**:
```
═══════════════════════════════════════════
SDLC Accelerate: CONSTRUCTION READY (with gaps)
═══════════════════════════════════════════

{N} conditional items require attention before or during iteration 1:
  - {item}: see .aiwg/reports/{gate}-report.md
  - {item}: see .aiwg/reports/{gate}-report.md

These are not blockers. Construction can begin.
Handoff document: .aiwg/reports/construction-ready-brief.md
═══════════════════════════════════════════
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Fresh project from idea

```bash
aiwg sdlc-accelerate "A CLI tool that monitors Bittensor subnet validator metrics and sends Slack alerts when performance scores drop below configurable thresholds."
```

Full pipeline runs. 13 artifacts generated in ~45 minutes. Construction Ready Brief at `.aiwg/reports/construction-ready-brief.md`. Iteration 1 plan ready for team kickoff.

### Example 2: Accelerate from existing codebase

```bash
aiwg sdlc-accelerate --from-codebase ./validator-monitor
```

Codebase is analyzed. Existing implementation informs the architecture baseline — SAD documents what was built rather than planning from scratch. ADRs capture inferred decisions. Use cases are derived from existing code paths and README. Useful for projects that were built without SDLC artifacts and now need them.

### Example 3: Preview before committing

```bash
aiwg sdlc-accelerate "Payment processing microservice with PCI DSS compliance requirements" --dry-run
```

Prints the full pipeline plan with artifact list and estimated duration. No files created. User reviews scope, then runs without `--dry-run`.

### Example 4: Resume after interruption

Session interrupted during Elaboration Wave 2 (SAD synthesis). Intake, LOM gate, and Wave 1 requirements were complete.

```bash
aiwg sdlc-accelerate --resume
```

Reads state file. Skips Intake, LOM gate, and Wave 1. Resumes at SAD synthesis. Continues through ABM gate, Construction Prep, and Brief. Only interrupted work re-runs.
