# AIWG Help

You display all available AIWG CLI commands, their arguments, and usage examples.

## Triggers

Alternate expressions and non-obvious activations (primary phrases are matched automatically from the skill description):

- "what can aiwg do" → run `aiwg help`
- "list aiwg commands" → run `aiwg help`
- "how do I use aiwg" → run `aiwg help`
- "aiwg commands" → run `aiwg help`
- "aiwg usage" → run `aiwg help`

## Trigger Patterns Reference

| Pattern | Example | Action |
|---------|---------|--------|
| General help | "help" / "show help" | Run `aiwg help` |
| Command listing | "what commands are available" | Run `aiwg help` |
| Usage question | "how do I use aiwg" | Run `aiwg help` |
| Capability query | "what can aiwg do" | Run `aiwg help` |
| Command discovery | "list aiwg commands" | Run `aiwg help` |

## Behavior

When triggered:

1. **Extract intent**: Determine whether the user wants the full command listing or is asking about a specific command or category. If a specific command is mentioned (e.g. "help with ralph"), direct the user to the relevant section.

2. **Run the appropriate command**:

   ```bash
   # Full help output
   aiwg help
   ```

   The help command is built into the CLI registry and requires no external tools. It renders command groups (Framework, Project, Workspace, MCP Server, Toolsmith, Scaffolding, Agent Loop, Maintenance) with aligned descriptions.

3. **Report the result** inline — present the command groups and highlight the most relevant section if the user expressed a specific area of interest.

## Examples

### Example 1: General help request

**User**: "What commands does AIWG have?"

**Extraction**: Full command listing requested, no specific area mentioned

**Action**:
```bash
aiwg help
```

**Response**: "Here are all available AIWG commands: [output]. The most commonly used are `aiwg use <framework>` to deploy a framework, `aiwg doctor` to check health, and `aiwg sync` to stay current."

### Example 2: Category-specific help

**User**: "How do I use the agent loop commands?"

**Extraction**: User wants help scoped to the Agent Loop category

**Action**:
```bash
aiwg help
```

**Response**: "The Agent Loop commands are: `aiwg ralph \"<task>\"` to start an iterative loop, `aiwg ralph-status` to check progress, `aiwg ralph-abort` to stop, and `aiwg ralph-resume` to continue an interrupted loop. Pass `--completion \"<criteria>\"` to define when the loop should stop."

### Example 3: Quick usage check

**User**: "usage"

**Extraction**: User wants the usage summary

**Action**:
```bash
aiwg help
```

**Response**: "Usage: `aiwg <command> [options]`. Run `aiwg help` for the full command listing, or ask about a specific command."
