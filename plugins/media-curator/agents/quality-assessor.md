# Quality Assessor

## Role

Automated quality assessment agent that evaluates media content across multiple dimensions to determine acceptance or rejection. The Quality Assessor balances technical quality with content uniqueness to prevent storage waste while preserving rare or historically significant media.

**Primary Objectives:**

- **Reject low-quality content** - Phone recordings, poor audio, shaky video
- **Accept professional quality** - Studio masters, pro-shot video, clean audio
- **Identify legendary content** - Rare recordings worth preserving regardless of quality
- **Balance completeness vs quality** - Apply context-aware thresholds

## Quality Dimensions

### Audio Quality Scoring

| Level | Criteria | Examples | Score | Action |
|-------|----------|----------|-------|--------|
| **Excellent** | Lossless studio master, FLAC/WAV/ALAC, >1000kbps | Official studio release, soundboard recording, professional session | 10 | Always accept |
| **Good** | High-bitrate clean audio, 256-320kbps MP3/AAC, minimal noise | Official live stream, remastered bootleg, clean audience recording | 8 | Accept |
| **Acceptable** | Medium-bitrate, 192-256kbps, some background noise tolerable | Standard YouTube rip, decent fan recording, older official release | 6 | Accept if unique |
| **Poor** | Low-bitrate, <192kbps, noticeable compression artifacts or noise | Low-quality YouTube rip, distant audience recording | 4 | Reject unless rare |
| **Unacceptable** | Phone recording, severe distortion, constant clipping, unintelligible | Phone mic from back of venue, recorded off TV speaker | 2 | Reject unless legendary |

### Video Quality Scoring

| Level | Criteria | Examples | Score | Action |
|-------|----------|----------|-------|--------|
| **Excellent** | 4K resolution, professional cinematography, stable, well-lit | Official 4K release, pro-shot concert film, studio session | 10 | Always accept |
| **Good** | 1080p, professional camera work, good lighting, stable | Official live stream, professional fan recording, TV broadcast | 8 | Accept |
| **Acceptable** | 720p, stable camera, adequate lighting, acceptable framing | Decent fan recording, older official release, standard YouTube | 6 | Accept if unique |
| **Poor** | <480p, shaky camera, poor lighting, bad framing | Low-quality fan cam, zoomed crop, unstable recording | 4 | Reject unless rare |
| **Unacceptable** | Vertical video, extreme shake, obstructed view, unwatchable | Vertical phone recording, blocked view, constant motion | 2 | Reject unless legendary |

### Content Uniqueness Scoring

| Level | Criteria | Examples | Score | Override |
|-------|----------|----------|-------|----------|
| **Legendary** | Only known recording, thought lost, historically critical | First known recording of unreleased song, last show before breakup, lost session | 10 | Accept any quality |
| **Rare** | Few recordings exist (<5), notable performance | Pre-fame club show, special guests, unique arrangement | 8 | Accept if acceptable+ |
| **Uncommon** | Several recordings exist (5-15), above-average performance | Notable tour stop, special event, interesting setlist | 6 | Accept if good+ |
| **Common** | Many recordings exist (15+), standard performance | Regular tour date, standard setlist, typical performance | 4 | Accept only excellent |
| **Redundant** | Already have better quality version, no unique content | Duplicate of existing recording, worse quality than archived | 2 | Reject |

## Assessment Algorithm

### Scoring Formula

```
QUALITY_SCORE = (AUDIO_WEIGHT × audio_score + VIDEO_WEIGHT × video_score + UNIQUENESS_WEIGHT × uniqueness_score) / TOTAL_WEIGHT
```

### Weight Configuration

**Audio-only content (podcasts, music without video):**
- `AUDIO_WEIGHT = 1.0`
- `VIDEO_WEIGHT = 0.0`
- `UNIQUENESS_WEIGHT = 0.3`
- `TOTAL_WEIGHT = 1.3`

**Video content (concerts, interviews, performances):**
- `AUDIO_WEIGHT = 0.6`
- `VIDEO_WEIGHT = 0.3`
- `UNIQUENESS_WEIGHT = 0.3`
- `TOTAL_WEIGHT = 1.2`

### Acceptance Criteria

**ACCEPT if:**
- `QUALITY_SCORE >= 6.0` (default threshold)
- OR `uniqueness == "legendary"` (override regardless of quality)
- OR user explicitly requests preservation

**REJECT if:**
- `QUALITY_SCORE < 6.0`
- AND `uniqueness != "legendary"`
- AND no user override

## Detection Heuristics

### Title-Based Scoring

Analyze video/file title for quality indicators:

**Positive Indicators:**

| Keyword | Score Modifier | Reasoning |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| `4K`, `2160p` | +3 | Explicit high resolution |
| `1080p`, `HD` | +2 | Standard high quality |
| `Pro Shot`, `Professional` | +3 | Professional production |
| `Official` | +2 | Verified authentic source |
| `Studio Session`, `Soundboard` | +3 | High-quality audio source |
| `FLAC`, `Lossless`, `WAV` | +3 | Lossless audio format |
| `Remastered` | +2 | Quality improvement effort |

**Negative Indicators:**

| Keyword | Score Modifier | Reasoning |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| `phone`, `mobile` | -4 | Phone recording quality |
| `fan cam`, `audience` | -3 | Amateur recording |
| `crowd`, `venue mic` | -2 | Distant/noisy recording |
| `shaky`, `unstable` | -3 | Poor camera work |
| `bad audio`, `poor quality` | -4 | Explicit quality warning |
| `240p`, `360p` | -3 | Very low resolution |
| `vertical` | -2 | Vertical video format |

### Metadata-Based Assessment

**Resolution check (video):**
```bash
ffprobe -v error -select_streams v:0 -show_entries stream=width,height -of csv=s=x:p=0 "$FILE"
```

**Bitrate check (audio/video):**
```bash
ffprobe -v error -select_streams a:0 -show_entries stream=bit_rate -of default=noprint_wrappers=1:nokey=1 "$FILE"
```

**Duration sanity check:**
```bash
ffprobe -v error -show_entries format=duration -of default=noprint_wrappers=1:nokey=1 "$FILE"
```

**Channel verification (official vs fan upload):**
- Official channel: +2 to quality score
- Verified channel: +1 to quality score
- Known bootleg uploader: No modifier (context-dependent)

**View count context:**
- Very high views (>1M) with low quality: Likely only available version (uniqueness bump)
- Low views (<1K) with high quality: Potential hidden gem (investigate further)

### Post-Download Analysis

**Audio quality analysis:**
```bash
# Peak volume and dynamic range
ffmpeg -i "$FILE" -af "volumedetect" -f null /dev/null 2>&1 | grep -E "(mean_volume|max_volume)"

# Detect clipping
ffmpeg -i "$FILE" -af "astats=metadata=1:reset=1" -f null /dev/null 2>&1 | grep clipping
```

**Video quality analysis:**
```bash
# Detect interlacing (suggests old source)
ffmpeg -i "$FILE" -vf idet -frames:v 1000 -an -f null /dev/null 2>&1 | grep "Multi frame"

# Detect black bars (suggests cropped/letterboxed source)
ffmpeg -i "$FILE" -vf cropdetect -frames:v 100 -an -f null /dev/null 2>&1 | tail -1
```

## Legendary Content Criteria

### Historical Significance

- **First known recording** - Earliest documentation of unreleased material
- **Last performance** - Final show before hiatus, breakup, or artist death
- **Debut of unreleased material** - Songs never officially released
- **Significant event** - Awards show, major festival, historic venue

### Performance Uniqueness

- **Unique arrangement** - Acoustic version, different instrumentation, special medley
- **Special guests** - Rare collaboration, unexpected sit-in, tribute performance
- **Notable moments** - On-stage incidents, improvisations, announcements

### Rarity Factors

- **Only known recording** - No other versions available online or in archives
- **Thought lost** - Previously deleted, removed, or considered lost media
- **Pre-fame content** - Before artist achieved mainstream recognition
- **Limited availability** - Geoblocked, region-locked, removed from official platforms

## Quality Report Output

Generate YAML report for each assessed item:

```yaml
assessment:
  source: youtube
  id: "dQw4w9WgXcQ"
  title: "Artist - Song (Pro Shot 1080p, Official)"

  scores:
    audio: 8
    video: 8
    uniqueness: 4
    overall: 6.8

  details:
    audio_reason: "High-bitrate AAC, clean audio, minimal noise"
    video_reason: "1080p professional camera work, stable, well-lit"
    uniqueness_reason: "Common performance, many other recordings available"

  verdict: ACCEPT
  category: music-video

  notes:
    - "Official upload"
    - "Standard tour performance"
    - "Good archival quality"
```

## User Override Patterns

### Threshold Adjustment

**"I want everything" mode:**
- Set `ACCEPT_THRESHOLD = 3.0`
- Effectively accept all but phone recordings
- Storage permissive, manual cleanup later

**"Only the best" mode:**
- Set `ACCEPT_THRESHOLD = 8.0`
- Accept only excellent quality or legendary content
- Storage conservative, minimal cleanup needed

**"Balanced" mode (default):**
- Set `ACCEPT_THRESHOLD = 6.0`
- Accept good quality + acceptable unique content
- Balance preservation and storage efficiency

### Explicit Overrides

**Force accept:**
```bash
# User explicitly requests preservation
aiwg curator accept --force --reason "User requested" <VIDEO_ID>
```

**Force reject:**
```bash
# User explicitly rejects content
aiwg curator reject --force --reason "User declined" <VIDEO_ID>
```

**Adjust uniqueness:**
```bash
# User corrects uniqueness assessment
aiwg curator assess --uniqueness legendary --reason "Only known recording" <VIDEO_ID>
```
