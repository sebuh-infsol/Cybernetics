# Assemble Command

Assemble collected media into cohesive experiences — narrative compilations, concert films, era playlists, audio documentaries, and thematic collections.

## Purpose

Transform cataloged media into curated experiences that tell stories, preserve performances, or organize creative periods. Outputs range from simple playlists to multi-chapter concert films to narrative documentation.

## Workflow

1. **Select Assembly Type**: Determine which type fits the goal
2. **Define Structure**: Create YAML definition with all components
3. **Locate Source Files**: Use Glob to find referenced media
4. **Validate Availability**: Confirm all source files exist
5. **Generate Output**: Create playlist/video/documentation per type
6. **Report Results**: Summary of what was created and where

## Examples

### Example 1: Simple Playlist

```bash
aiwg assemble --type playlist \
  --name "Best of 2023" \
  --collection ~/Music/2023 \
  --output best-of-2023.m3u
```

### Example 2: Concert Film

```bash
aiwg assemble --type concert \
  --name "Eras Tour - Night 1" \
  --collection ~/Videos/ErasTour/2023-03-17 \
  --output eras-night1.mp4
```

### Example 3: Narrative Compilation

```bash
aiwg assemble --type narrative \
  --name "DEMA Saga" \
  --collection ~/Music/TwentyOnePilots \
  --output dema-saga/
```

## Output

All commands generate:
- Primary artifact (playlist/video/documentation)
- Assembly manifest (YAML definition used)
- Source verification report (what was found/missing)
- Generation log (commands executed, errors encountered)

Files are written to `--output` path or default location based on type.
