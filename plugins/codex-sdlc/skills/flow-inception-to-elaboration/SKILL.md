# Inception → Elaboration Phase Transition Flow

**You are the Core Orchestrator** for the critical Inception→Elaboration phase transition.

## Your Role

**You orchestrate multi-agent workflows. You do NOT execute bash scripts.**

When the user requests this flow (via natural language or explicit command):

1. **Interpret the request** and confirm understanding
2. **Read this template** as your orchestration guide
3. **Extract agent assignments** and workflow steps
4. **Launch agents via Task tool** in correct sequence
5. **Synthesize results** and finalize artifacts
6. **Report completion** with summary

## Phase Transition Overview

**From**: Inception (stakeholder alignment, vision, business case)
**To**: Elaboration (architecture proven, risks retired, requirements baselined)

**Key Milestone**: Architecture Baseline Milestone (ABM)

**Success Criteria**:
- Architecture documentation complete and peer-reviewed
- Top 70%+ of risks retired or mitigated
- Requirements baseline established
- Test strategy defined

**Expected Duration**: 4-8 weeks (typical), 15-20 minutes orchestration

## Natural Language Triggers

Users may say:
- "Let's transition to Elaboration"
- "Move to Elaboration"
- "Start Elaboration phase"
- "Create architecture baseline"
- "Generate SAD and ADRs"

You recognize these as requests for this orchestration flow.

## Parameter Handling

### --guidance Parameter

**Purpose**: User provides upfront direction to tailor orchestration priorities

**Examples**:
```
--guidance "Focus on security architecture, HIPAA compliance critical"
--guidance "Tight timeline, prioritize steel thread validation over comprehensive documentation"
--guidance "Team has limited DevOps experience, need extra infrastructure support"
--guidance "Performance is critical path, optimize for sub-100ms p95 response time"
```

**How to Apply**:
- Parse guidance for keywords: security, performance, compliance, timeline, team skills
- Adjust agent assignments (add security-architect, privacy-officer for compliance focus)
- Modify artifact depth (minimal vs comprehensive based on timeline)
- Influence priority ordering (architecture vs. requirements focus)

### --interactive Parameter

**Purpose**: You ask 5-8 strategic questions to understand project context

**Questions to Ask** (if --interactive):

```
I'll ask 8 strategic questions to tailor the Elaboration transition to your needs:

Q1: What are your top priorities for Elaboration?
    (e.g., security validation, performance proof, compliance requirements)

Q2: What percentage of requirements do you estimate are understood?
    (Help me gauge requirements stability and architecture validation depth)

Q3: What are your biggest architectural unknowns?
    (These become POC/spike targets for risk retirement)

Q4: What's your team's size and composition?
    (Helps me assign realistic agent coordination and activity scope)

Q5: How tight is your timeline for Elaboration?
    (Influences whether to generate comprehensive vs. minimal viable documentation)

Q6: What domain expertise does your team have?
    (Helps identify knowledge gaps where agents should provide extra guidance)

Q7: Are there regulatory or compliance requirements?
    (e.g., HIPAA, SOC2, PCI-DSS - affects security/privacy agent assignments)

Q8: What's your testing maturity?
    (Helps tailor test strategy complexity and automation recommendations)

Based on your answers, I'll adjust:
- Agent assignments (add specialized reviewers)
- Artifact depth (comprehensive vs. streamlined)
- Priority ordering (security-first vs. performance-first)
- Risk validation approach (POC scope and focus areas)
```

**Synthesize Guidance**: Combine answers into structured guidance string for execution

## Artifacts to Generate

**Primary Deliverables**:
- **Software Architecture Document (SAD)**: Comprehensive architecture → `.aiwg/architecture/software-architecture-doc.md`
- **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**: 3-5 major decisions → `.aiwg/architecture/adr/ADR-*.md`
- **Master Test Plan**: Testing strategy and coverage targets → `.aiwg/testing/master-test-plan.md`
- **Requirements Baseline**: Use cases and NFRs → `.aiwg/requirements/`
- **Risk Retirement Report**: POC results and status → `.aiwg/risks/risk-retirement-report.md`
- **Elaboration Phase Plan**: Activities and schedule → `.aiwg/planning/phase-plan-elaboration.md`
- **ABM Report**: Milestone readiness assessment → `.aiwg/reports/abm-report.md`

**Supporting Artifacts**:
- Architecture Baseline Plan (working doc)
- LOM Validation Report (gate check)
- Complete audit trails (archived workflows)

## Multi-Agent Orchestration Workflow

### Step 1: Validate Inception Exit Criteria (LOM)

**Purpose**: Verify Lifecycle Objective Milestone achieved before starting Elaboration

**Your Actions**:

1. **Check for Required Inception Artifacts**:
   ```
   Read and verify presence of:
   - .aiwg/intake/project-intake.md
   - .aiwg/requirements/vision-*.md
   - .aiwg/planning/business-case-*.md
   - .aiwg/risks/risk-list.md
   - .aiwg/security/data-classification.md
   ```

2. **Launch Gate Check Agent**:
   ```
   Task(
       subagent_type="project-manager",
       description="Validate Inception gate (LOM) criteria",
       prompt="""
       Read gate criteria from: $AIWG_ROOT/agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/flows/gate-criteria-by-phase.md

       Validate LOM criteria:
       - Vision document APPROVED (stakeholder signoff ≥75%)
       - Business case APPROVED (funding secured)
       - Risk list BASELINED (5-10 risks, top 3 have mitigation plans)
       - Data classification COMPLETE
       - Architecture scan documented
       - Executive Sponsor approval obtained

       Generate LOM Validation Report:
       - Status: PASS | FAIL
       - Criteria checklist with results
       - Decision: GO to Elaboration | NO-GO
       - Gaps (if NO-GO): List missing artifacts

       Save to: .aiwg/reports/lom-validation-report.md
       """
   )
   ```

3. **Decision Point**:
   - If LOM PASS → Continue to Step 2
   - If LOM FAIL → Report gaps to user, recommend `/flow-concept-to-inception` to complete Inception
   - Escalate to user for executive decision if criteria partially met

**Communicate Progress**:
```
✓ Initialized LOM validation
⏳ Validating Inception exit criteria...
✓ LOM Validation complete: [PASS | FAIL]
```

### Step 2: Plan Architecture Baseline Development

**Purpose**: Define architecture objectives and select steel thread use cases

**Your Actions**:

1. **Read Intake and Risk Context**:
   ```
   Read:
   - .aiwg/intake/project-intake.md (understand project scope)
   - .aiwg/risks/risk-list.md (identify architectural risks)
   - .aiwg/requirements/vision-*.md (understand quality attributes)
   ```

2. **Launch Architecture Planning Agents** (parallel):
   ```
   # Agent 1: Architecture Designer
   Task(
       subagent_type="architecture-designer",
       description="Define architecture objectives and drivers",
       prompt="""
       Read project intake and vision documents

       Define for Architecture Baseline Plan:
       - Architectural drivers (quality attributes: performance, security, scalability)
       - Architectural constraints (technology, budget, timeline)
       - Component boundaries (logical decomposition approach)
       - Technology stack candidates (languages, frameworks, databases)
       - Integration architecture approach (APIs, external systems)

       Draft architecture objectives section
       Save to: .aiwg/working/elaboration/planning/architecture-objectives-draft.md
       """
   )

   # Agent 2: Requirements Analyst
   Task(
       subagent_type="requirements-analyst",
       description="Identify architecturally significant use cases",
       prompt="""
       Read vision and risk list

       Select 2-3 Steel Thread Use Cases:
       - Must exercise key architectural patterns
       - Must address high-priority architectural risks
       - Must demonstrate end-to-end flow (UI → logic → data)
       - Must include external system integration (if applicable)

       For each use case document:
       - Why architecturally significant (technical complexity, risk coverage)
       - Risks addressed (map to risk IDs)
       - Acceptance criteria (how to validate architecture works)

       Draft steel thread use cases section
       Save to: .aiwg/working/elaboration/planning/steel-thread-use-cases-draft.md
       """
   )

   # Agent 3: System Analyst
   Task(
       subagent_type="system-analyst",
       description="Define risk validation approach",
       prompt="""
       Read risk list

       For top 3 architectural risks:
       - Define validation approach (spike, POC, performance test)
       - Specify acceptance criteria (what proves risk is retired)
       - Recommend scope (minimal, standard, comprehensive)
       - Estimate effort (days/weeks)

       Document risk validation strategy
       Save to: .aiwg/working/elaboration/planning/risk-validation-strategy-draft.md
       """
   )
   ```

3. **Synthesize Architecture Baseline Plan**:
   ```
   Task(
       subagent_type="documentation-synthesizer",
       description="Create unified Architecture Baseline Plan",
       prompt="""
       Read all planning drafts:
       - .aiwg/working/elaboration/planning/architecture-objectives-draft.md
       - .aiwg/working/elaboration/planning/steel-thread-use-cases-draft.md
       - .aiwg/working/elaboration/planning/risk-validation-strategy-draft.md

       Synthesize into cohesive Architecture Baseline Plan:
       1. Architecture Objectives
       2. Steel Thread Use Cases
       3. Risk Validation Strategy
       4. Team Assignments (placeholder for user to fill)
       5. Schedule (4-8 weeks broken into phases)

       Use template: $AIWG_ROOT/agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/templates/planning/phase-plan-template.md

       Output: .aiwg/planning/architecture-baseline-plan.md
       """
   )
   ```

**Communicate Progress**:
```
✓ LOM validation complete
⏳ Planning architecture baseline development...
  ✓ Architecture objectives defined
  ✓ Steel thread use cases identified (2-3)
  ✓ Risk validation strategy created
✓ Architecture Baseline Plan complete: .aiwg/planning/architecture-baseline-plan.md
```

### Step 3: Develop Architecture Baseline (SAD) - Multi-Agent Pattern

**Purpose**: Create comprehensive Software Architecture Document using multi-agent collaboration

**Template**: `$AIWG_ROOT/agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/templates/analysis-design/software-architecture-doc-template.md`

**Output**: `.aiwg/architecture/software-architecture-doc.md` (BASELINED)

**Agent Assignments** (from template metadata):

```

**Wait for completion**, then update user:
```
✓ Architecture Designer created SAD v0.1 draft (estimated 3,000-5,000 words)
```

#### 3.3: Parallel Multi-Agent Review

**Launch all reviewers simultaneously** (single message with 4 Task calls):

```
Task(
    subagent_type="architecture-documenter",
    description="Synthesize SAD review feedback",
    prompt="""
    Read primary draft: .aiwg/working/architecture/sad/drafts/v0.1-primary-draft.md

```

**Update user**:
```
✓ Archived workflow: .aiwg/archive/{date}/sad-{date}/
```

### Step 4: Create Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

**Purpose**: Document 3-5 major architectural decisions identified in SAD

**Template**: `$AIWG_ROOT/agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/templates/analysis-design/architecture-decision-record-template.md`

**Your Actions**:

1. **Extract Decisions from SAD**:
   ```
   Read .aiwg/architecture/software-architecture-doc.md
   Identify section "Key Decisions" (3-5 major decisions)
   ```

2. **For Each Decision, Launch ADR Creation** (can be parallel):
   ```
   Task(
       subagent_type="architecture-designer",
       description="Create ADR-{number}: {decision-title}",
       prompt="""
       Read SAD: .aiwg/architecture/software-architecture-doc.md
       Read ADR template: $AIWG_ROOT/.../architecture-decision-record-template.md

       Create ADR for decision: {decision-title}

       Structure:
       1. Status: Proposed | Accepted | Superseded
       2. Context: What is the issue we're facing?
       3. Decision: What is the change we're making?
       4. Consequences: What are the impacts (positive, negative, risks)?
       5. Alternatives Considered: What other options were evaluated? Why rejected?

       Example decisions to document:
       - Database Selection (PostgreSQL vs MySQL vs MongoDB)
       - API Architecture (REST vs GraphQL vs gRPC)
       - Authentication Strategy (OAuth vs JWT vs session-based)
       - Deployment Model (monolith vs microservices)
       - Cloud Provider Selection (AWS vs Azure vs GCP)

       Technical depth: Elaborate on trade-offs, not just "we chose X"

       Save to: .aiwg/architecture/adr/ADR-{number:03d}-{slug}.md
       (e.g., ADR-001-database-selection.md)
       """
   )
   ```

3. **Quick Review Cycle** (parallel reviewers):
   ```
   # Launch 2-3 reviewers for each ADR:
   # - Security Architect (if security-relevant decision)
   # - Test Architect (for testability impacts)
   # - Technical Writer (for clarity)

   # Lighter review than SAD (5-10 min per reviewer)
   # Focus on: decision rationale complete, alternatives documented, consequences realistic
   ```

**Communicate Progress**:
```
⏳ Creating ADRs (3-5 decisions)...
  ✓ ADR-001: Database Selection (PostgreSQL) - APPROVED
  ✓ ADR-002: API Architecture (REST + GraphQL) - APPROVED
  ✓ ADR-003: Authentication (OAuth 2.0 + JWT) - APPROVED
  ✓ ADR-004: Deployment Model (Kubernetes) - CONDITIONAL → RESOLVED
✓ ADRs baselined: .aiwg/architecture/adr/ (3-5 files)
```

### Step 5: Retire Architectural Risks

**Purpose**: Validate high-risk assumptions via POCs, update risk list

**Your Actions**:

1. **Read Risk List and Identify High-Priority Risks**:
   ```
   Read .aiwg/risks/risk-list.md
   Filter for:
   - Priority: P0 (Show Stopper) or P1 (High)
   - Category: Architectural or Technical
   - Status: Open or Identified (not yet retired)
   ```

2. **For Each High-Risk Assumption, Launch Risk Validation**:
   ```
   # Option A: Build POC (if technical feasibility needs proof)
   Task(
       subagent_type="software-implementer",
       description="Build POC for Risk #{risk-id}",
       prompt="""
       Risk to validate: {risk-description}

       Use /build-poc command to create proof of concept:
       /build-poc "{risk-description}" --scope {minimal|standard|comprehensive}

       Acceptance criteria: {what proves risk is retired}

       Output POC results to: .aiwg/risks/poc-{risk-id}-results.md

       Document:
       - POC approach (what was tested)
       - Results (metrics, observations)
       - Decision: GO (risk retired) | NO-GO (risk remains) | PIVOT (change approach)
       """
   )

### Step 6: Baseline Requirements and Test Strategy

**Purpose**: Document use cases, NFRs, and Master Test Plan

**Your Actions**:

1. **Create Use Case Specifications** (parallel):
   ```
   Task(
       subagent_type="requirements-analyst",
       description="Create use case specifications (10+ use cases)",
       prompt="""
       Read architecture baseline plan: .aiwg/planning/architecture-baseline-plan.md
       Read steel thread use cases (already identified)

       Create 10+ use case specifications:
       - Top 3: Steel thread use cases (architecturally significant, already validated)
       - Remaining 7+: Functional requirements for Construction

       Template: $AIWG_ROOT/.../use-case-spec-template.md

       For each use case:
       1. Use Case ID and Name
       2. Actors (who interacts)
       3. Preconditions (system state before)
       4. Main Flow (happy path steps)
       5. Alternative Flows (error cases, edge cases)
       6. Postconditions (system state after)
       7. Acceptance Criteria (how to test)
       8. Component Mapping (which SAD components implement this)

       Ensure traceability: Use Case → SAD Components

       Output: .aiwg/requirements/use-case-{id}-{name}.md (10+ files)
       """
   )
   ```

2. **Create Supplemental Specification (NFRs)**:
   ```
   Task(
       subagent_type="requirements-analyst",
       description="Document non-functional requirements",
       prompt="""
       Read SAD quality attributes
       Read architecture baseline plan

       Create Supplemental Specification covering:

       1. Performance
          - Response time: p50, p95, p99 (e.g., p95 < 500ms)
          - Throughput: requests/second (e.g., 1000 req/s)

       2. Scalability
          - Concurrent users (e.g., 10,000 simultaneous)
          - Data volume (e.g., 1M records, 10GB database)

       3. Availability
          - Uptime target (e.g., 99.9% = 43 min downtime/month)
          - SLA definition (service level agreement)

       4. Security (reference SAD security architecture)
          - Authentication: OAuth 2.0, JWT
          - Authorization: RBAC
          - Audit: All user actions logged

       5. Usability
          - Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 Level AA
          - Internationalization: English, Spanish, French

       6. Maintainability
          - Coding standards: (reference or define)
          - Documentation: Inline comments, API docs
          - Technical debt: Policy for addressing

       Template: $AIWG_ROOT/.../supplemental-specification-template.md

       Output: .aiwg/requirements/supplemental-specification.md
       """
   )
   ```

3. **Create Master Test Plan**:
   ```
   Task(
       subagent_type="test-architect",
       description="Develop Master Test Plan",
       prompt="""
       Read SAD testability sections
       Read supplemental specification (NFRs)
       Read use case specifications

       Create Master Test Plan covering:

       1. Test Strategy
          - Test types: Unit, Integration, System, Acceptance, Performance, Security
          - Test levels: Component, Service, End-to-End

       2. Coverage Targets
          - Unit tests: ≥80% code coverage
          - Integration tests: ≥70% API coverage
          - End-to-End: ≥50% user journey coverage

       3. Test Environments
          - Development: Local, Docker Compose
          - Test: Shared environment, CI/CD integrated
          - Staging: Production-like, final validation
          - Production: Smoke tests only

       4. Test Data Strategy
          - Synthetic data: Generated for unit/integration
          - Anonymized data: Production data sanitized for staging
          - Production-like: Realistic volume and variety

       5. Test Automation
          - Unit: Jest (JS), Pytest (Python)
          - Integration: Postman, REST Assured
          - E2E: Playwright, Selenium
          - CI Integration: GitHub Actions, Jenkins

       6. Defect Management
          - Triage: P0 (blocker), P1 (critical), P2 (major), P3 (minor), P4 (trivial)
          - Tracking: Jira, GitHub Issues
          - Resolution SLAs: P0 = 4 hours, P1 = 24 hours, P2 = 3 days

       Template: $AIWG_ROOT/.../master-test-plan-template.md

       Output: .aiwg/testing/master-test-plan.md
       """
   )
   ```

**Communicate Progress**:
```
⏳ Baselining requirements and test strategy...
  ✓ Use case specifications created (10+ use cases)
  ✓ Supplemental specification (NFRs) complete
  ✓ Master Test Plan approved
✓ Requirements baseline: .aiwg/requirements/ (10+ files + supplemental spec)
✓ Test strategy: .aiwg/testing/master-test-plan.md
```

### Step 7: Conduct Architecture Baseline Milestone (ABM) Review

**Purpose**: Formal gate review to decide GO/NO-GO to Construction

**Your Actions**:

1. **Validate ABM Criteria**:
   ```
   Task(
       subagent_type="project-manager",
       description="Validate ABM gate criteria",
       prompt="""
       Read gate criteria: $AIWG_ROOT/.../flows/gate-criteria-by-phase.md (Elaboration section)

       4. Test Strategy
          - [ ] Master Test Plan approved
          - [ ] Test environments operational (dev, test)

       Report status: PASS | CONDITIONAL PASS | FAIL

       Output: .aiwg/reports/abm-criteria-validation.md
       """
   )
   ```

2. **Generate ABM Report**:
   ```
   Task(
       subagent_type="project-manager",
       description="Generate Architecture Baseline Milestone Report",
       prompt="""
       Read all Elaboration artifacts:
       - .aiwg/architecture/software-architecture-doc.md
       - .aiwg/architecture/adr/*.md
       - .aiwg/risks/risk-list.md
       - .aiwg/requirements/*.md
       - .aiwg/testing/master-test-plan.md

## Quality Gates

Before marking workflow complete, verify:
- [ ] All required artifacts generated and BASELINED
- [ ] All reviewers provided sign-off (APPROVED or CONDITIONAL resolved)
- [ ] Final artifacts saved to .aiwg/{category}/
- [ ] Working drafts archived to .aiwg/archive/
- [ ] Synthesis reports document all changes
- [ ] ABM criteria validated: PASS or CONDITIONAL PASS

## User Communication

**At start**: Confirm understanding and list artifacts to generate

```
Understood. I'll orchestrate the Inception → Elaboration transition.

This will generate:
- Software Architecture Document (SAD)
- Architecture Decision Records (3-5 ADRs)
- Master Test Plan
- Requirements Baseline (10+ use cases + NFRs)
- Risk Retirement Report
- Elaboration Phase Plan
- ABM Report

I'll coordinate multiple agents for comprehensive review.
Expected duration: 15-20 minutes.

Starting orchestration...
```

**During**: Update progress with clear indicators

```
✓ = Complete
⏳ = In progress
❌ = Error/blocked
⚠️ = Warning/attention needed
```

**At end**: Summary report with artifact locations and status (see Step 7.3 above)

## Error Handling

**If LOM Not Met**:
```
❌ Inception phase incomplete - cannot proceed to Elaboration

Gaps identified:
- {list missing artifacts or incomplete criteria}

Recommendation: Complete Inception first
- Run: /flow-concept-to-inception
- Or: Complete missing artifacts manually

Contact Executive Sponsor for project status decision.
```

**If POC/Spike Failed**:
```
❌ Critical POC failed - technical feasibility not proven

Risk: {risk-description}
POC Result: {NO-GO reason}

Actions:
1. Identify technical blockers
2. Consider architecture pivot or technology change
3. Conduct additional investigation spike

Impact: ABM blocked until technical feasibility proven or risk accepted by sponsor.

Escalating to user for decision...
```

**If Risk Retirement Insufficient**:
```
⚠️ Risk retirement {percentage}% (target: ≥70%)

Outstanding risks:
- {risk-1}: {status}
- {risk-2}: {status}

Recommendation: Conduct additional spikes/POCs to retire critical risks

Impact: ABM may result in CONDITIONAL GO or NO-GO if risk retirement remains insufficient.
```

**If Review Conflicts Unresolvable**:
```
⚠️ Review conflict requires user decision

Conflict: {description}
- Security Architect: {position}
- Performance Architect: {opposing position}

Trade-off analysis:
- Option A: {pros/cons}
- Option B: {pros/cons}

Escalating to user for architectural decision...
```

## Success Criteria

This orchestration succeeds when:
- [ ] Lifecycle Objective Milestone validated (LOM complete)
- [ ] Architecture Baseline Plan created
- [ ] Software Architecture Document BASELINED (multi-agent reviewed)
- [ ] ADRs documented (3-5 major decisions)
- [ ] Risks retired ≥70% (P0/P1 100% retired/mitigated)
- [ ] POCs/Spikes completed for high-risk assumptions
- [ ] Requirements baseline ESTABLISHED (10+ use cases + NFRs)
- [ ] Master Test Plan APPROVED
- [ ] ABM review conducted with GO/CONDITIONAL GO decision
- [ ] Complete audit trails archived

## Metrics to Track

**During orchestration, track**:
- Architecture stability: % of architectural changes (target: <10% after ABM)
- POC/Spike completion: % of planned validations completed (target: 100%)
- Risk retirement velocity: % of risks resolved per week
- Review consensus: % of reviews APPROVED vs CONDITIONAL vs NEEDS_WORK
- Cycle time: Elaboration phase duration (target: 4-8 weeks, orchestration: 15-20 min)
