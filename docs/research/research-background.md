## Overview

The AIWG framework synthesizes findings from cognitive science, multi-agent systems, software engineering, and archival science to create a research-backed cognitive architecture for AI-augmented software development. This document provides a comprehensive review of the theoretical foundations, empirical evidence, and standards that inform AIWG's design decisions.

AIWG is not a collection of prompt engineering heuristics—it is a systematic integration of established principles from multiple disciplines, operationalized through structured memory, multi-agent coordination, and closed-loop self-correction patterns.

---

## Research Domains

AIWG draws from five primary research domains:

## Theoretical Foundations

### 1. Cognitive Science: Working Memory and Load Management

#### Miller's Law (1956): The Magical Number Seven

**Finding**: Human working memory is limited to 7±2 chunks of information. Complex information must be decomposed into hierarchical structures to remain cognitively manageable.

**AIWG Application**:
- **Phase decomposition**: SDLC divided into Inception → Elaboration → Construction → Transition (4 phases, well within 7±2)
- **Agent specialization**: 53 agents organized into 8 role categories (not 53 flat agents)
- **Template structure**: Sections limited to 5-7 major headings
- **Review panels**: 3-5 reviewers recommended (not 10+)

**Implementation Pattern**:
```yaml
# Hierarchical organization respecting cognitive limits
sdlc_phases:
  count: 4  # Well within 7±2
  inception:
    artifacts: [intake, solution-profile, initial-requirements]  # 3 items
  elaboration:
    artifacts: [use-cases, architecture, test-strategy, risks]  # 4 items
```

**Key Quote** (Miller, 1956):
> "The span of absolute judgment and the span of immediate memory impose severe limitations on the amount of information that we are able to receive, process, and remember."

---

#### Sweller's Cognitive Load Theory (1988)

**Finding**: Learning and problem-solving effectiveness depends on managing three types of cognitive load: intrinsic (task complexity), extraneous (presentation), and germane (schema construction).

**AIWG Application**:
- **Intrinsic load management**: Complex tasks decomposed into phases
- **Extraneous load reduction**: Consistent templates eliminate format decisions
- **Germane load optimization**: @-mentions build schema across artifacts

**Implementation**: Templates reduce extraneous load by providing structure, allowing agents to focus cognitive resources on problem-solving rather than format decisions.

---

### 2. Reasoning Patterns: From Chain-of-Thought to Tree Search

#### REF-016: Chain-of-Thought Prompting (Wei et al., 2022)

**Finding**: Prompting large language models to generate intermediate reasoning steps improves performance on complex tasks. CoT is an emergent ability requiring >100B parameter models.

**Benchmark Results** (PaLM 540B):
- GSM8K math: 17.9% → 56.9% (+39.0% absolute)
- Date understanding: 49.0% → 65.3% (+16.3%)

**AIWG Application**:
- **Templates** encode step-by-step reasoning patterns
- **Agent prompts** include explicit reasoning sections
- **Flow commands** implement multi-step procedures as exemplars
- **ADRs** document decision chains (options → evaluation → selection)

**Key Insight**: CoT has larger gains for more complex problems—exactly the domain AIWG targets (architecture, security, planning).

---

#### REF-017: Self-Consistency (Wang et al., 2023)

**Finding**: Sampling multiple reasoning paths and selecting the most consistent answer via majority voting significantly improves accuracy. Diversity of paths matters more than quantity.

**Benchmark Results**:
- GSM8K: 56.5% → 74.4% (+17.9% with self-consistency)
- 5-10 paths capture ~80-90% of maximum gain
- Simple majority voting outperforms complex weighting schemes

**AIWG Application**:
- **Multi-agent review panels**: 3-5 specialized reviewers sample diverse reasoning paths
- **Consensus-based synthesis**: Synthesizer aggregates findings via implicit voting
- **Disagreement signals**: Low reviewer agreement triggers escalation to human

**Implementation Pattern**:
```markdown
Architecture Review Panel:
  - Security Auditor (threat perspective)
  - Performance Architect (scalability perspective)
  - Maintainability Reviewer (evolution perspective)
  → Synthesizer aggregates consensus findings
```

**Cost-Performance Trade-off**: 3 specialized reviewers + 1 synthesizer balances cost (4× base) and quality (+15-20% over single agent).

**Key Quote** (Wang et al., 2023):
> "Diversity of the reasoning paths is the key to a better performance... One can use self-consistency to provide an uncertainty estimate of the model."

---

#### REF-018: ReAct - Reasoning and Acting (Yao et al., 2023)

**Finding**: Interleaving reasoning traces with tool actions grounds LLM outputs in external observations, eliminating hallucination on fact-based tasks (0% hallucination vs 56% for CoT-only).

**Benchmark Results**:
- HotpotQA: ReAct achieves 27% vs 20% for CoT
- Fever: ReAct reduces hallucination to 0% (vs 56% CoT baseline)

**AIWG Application**:
- **Test Engineer**: Thought→Action→Observation loop for test execution
- **DevOps Engineer**: Reasoning about deployment state + tool execution
- **API Designer**: Exploration of existing APIs via tool calls
- **Security Auditor**: Threat identification + validation via tools

**Thought Types** (from paper):
1. Goal decomposition
2. Progress tracking
3. Information extraction
4. Commonsense reasoning
5. Exception handling
6. Answer synthesis

**Key Benefit**: External grounding prevents fabricated information—critical for security assessments, deployment planning, and test validation.

---

#### REF-020: Tree of Thoughts (Yao et al., 2023)

**Finding**: Enabling deliberate search over thought trees (generate multiple options, evaluate, backtrack if needed) dramatically improves planning tasks. Game of 24: 4% → 74% success rate (18.5× improvement).

**AIWG Application**:
- **Phase gates**: Decision points with explicit option evaluation
- **ADRs**: Document alternatives, criteria, selection rationale
- **Architecture selection**: Generate k options, evaluate trade-offs, select best
- **Agent loop recovery**: Try strategy A, evaluate, backtrack if failing, try strategy B

**Implementation Pattern**:
```markdown
ADR Template (ToT-inspired):
  1. Options Considered (3-5 alternatives)
  2. Evaluation Criteria (specific, measurable)
  3. Trade-off Analysis (each option vs criteria)
  4. Decision & Rationale (selected + reasoning)
  5. Backup Strategy (if primary fails)
```

**When to Apply**: Architecture selection, risk mitigation planning, test strategy design, deployment approach—all benefit from explicit tree search.

---

#### REF-019: Toolformer - Self-Taught Tool Use (Schick et al., 2023)

**Finding**: LLMs can learn to use tools via self-supervised learning based on perplexity reduction. Few-shot prompting (2-3 examples) sufficient for tool adoption.

**AIWG Application**:
- **Agent capability development**: Self-evaluation of utility
- **Perplexity-based filtering**: Quality scoring for generated artifacts
- **Few-shot onboarding**: Agents learn new tools from minimal examples
- **Zero-shot transfer**: Tool patterns generalize across domains

**Scale Threshold**: 775M+ parameters needed for emergent tool use—all modern LLMs exceed this.

---

### 3. Multi-Agent Systems: Specialization and Coordination

#### REF-007: Mixture of Experts (Jacobs et al., 1991)

**Finding**: Decomposing complex problems across specialized sub-networks with gating mechanisms outperforms monolithic models. Each expert specializes in a subdomain.

**AIWG Application**:
- **53 specialized agents** vs single general-purpose agent
- **Capability-based dispatch**: Executive Orchestrator routes tasks to appropriate agents
- **Phase-based specialization**: Different agents active in different SDLC phases

**Key Principle**: Specialization improves quality and enables hierarchical cost optimization (use cheaper models for routine tasks, expensive models for complex decisions).

---

#### REF-004: MAGIS Multi-Agent Framework (Tao et al., 2024)

**Finding**: Multi-agent collaboration with role specialization, structured communication, and iterative refinement improves software engineering task performance.

**AIWG Alignment**:
- Both use SDLC phase structure
- Both employ specialized agents (requirements, architecture, testing, deployment)
- Both implement human-in-the-loop validation gates

**AIWG Differentiation**:
- Adds structured memory (.aiwg/ artifacts) vs ephemeral context
- Implements closed-loop recovery (Al) vs linear workflows
- Provides cross-platform deployment (Claude, Cursor, Copilot, etc.)

---

#### REF-057: Agent Laboratory (Schmidgall et al., 2025)

**Finding**: Human-in-the-loop pattern with draft-then-edit workflow achieves 84% cost reduction while maintaining quality competitive with human-written outputs.

**Critical Insight**:
> "Human oversight remains essential at decision points: hypothesis selection, result interpretation, and final approval."

**AIWG Application**:
- **Phase gates**: Require human approval for transitions
- **Draft-then-edit pattern**: Agent drafts → Human reviews → Human edits → Agent polishes → Human approves
- **Cost-quality balance**: Automate clerical work (search, formatting), keep humans on judgment calls

**What Gets Automated** (84% of cost):
- Document search and acquisition
- Metadata extraction
- Initial summarization
- Citation formatting
- Draft generation

**What Stays Human** (16% of cost, 100% of critical decisions):
- Topic relevance assessment
- Methodology evaluation
- Integration priority
- Final approval

**Implementation Pattern**:
```yaml
research_documentation_workflow:
  step_1: agent_draft          # Research Acquisition Agent
  step_2: human_review          # Expert reviews accuracy
  step_3: human_edit            # Expert adds domain knowledge
  step_4: agent_polish          # Technical Writer improves clarity
  step_5: human_approve         # Final sign-off (gate)
```

---

### 4. Memory and Retrieval: External Memory and Anti-Hallucination

#### REF-008: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Lewis et al., 2020)

**Finding**: Augmenting LLMs with external retrieval mechanisms (non-parametric memory) improves factual accuracy, reduces hallucination, and enables dynamic knowledge updates without retraining.

**AIWG Application**:
- **.aiwg/ directory**: Persistent external memory across sessions
- **@-mentions**: Explicit retrieval mechanism in prompts
- **REF-XXX system**: Structured knowledge base for research
- **Template library**: Reusable patterns retrieved on demand

**Key Benefit**: Unlike pure parametric models (trained once, static knowledge), RAG enables continuous learning through artifact accumulation.

---

#### REF-059: LitLLM Anti-Hallucination Architecture (ServiceNow, 2025)

**Finding**: Retrieval-first architecture (never generate citations without retrieval) reduces hallucination from 56% to 0% for literature review tasks.

**Core Principle**: **Never generate citations from parametric memory—always retrieve from verified sources.**

**AIWG Application**:
- **Citation whitelist**: Agent prompts forbid generating references without retrieval
- **Key Quotes with page numbers**: Grounded generation requirement
- **Post-generation validation**: Citation verification pipeline
- **REF-XXX verification**: DOI/URL required for all references

**Implementation**:
```markdown
Agent Prompt Rule (Citation Integrity):
  "You may ONLY cite papers from the research corpus (@docs/references/).
   NEVER generate citations from training data.
   All quotes MUST include page numbers.
   If unsure, state 'no relevant citation found' rather than fabricating."
```

**Key Statistic**: 56% hallucination rate for generation-only vs 0% for retrieval-first.

---

### 5. Standards Alignment: FAIR, OAIS, PROV, GRADE, MCP

AIWG aligns with internationally recognized standards to ensure professional credibility and interoperability.

#### REF-056: FAIR Guiding Principles (Wilkinson et al., 2016)

**Standard**: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable principles for scientific data management.

- **F2 (Rich Metadata)**: Document Profile section with structured metadata
- **A1 (Retrievable Protocol)**: Git/HTTPS access with open protocols
- **A2 (Metadata Persistence)**: Summaries remain useful even if source PDFs unavailable
- **I1 (Formal Language)**: Consistent template structure
- **R1 (Provenance)**: Revision history, acquisition date, source tracking

**Compliance Assessment**: AIWG achieves 8/12 FAIR principles (67% coverage). Gaps include machine-actionable YAML frontmatter and automated provenance records (planned enhancements).

---

#### REF-061: OAIS Reference Model (ISO 14721:2025)

**Standard**: Open Archival Information System—international standard for long-term digital preservation.

**AIWG Application**:

- **AIP (Archival Information Package)**: REF-XXX.md documents with full metadata
- **DIP (Dissemination Information Package)**: BibTeX exports, citable claims
- **Fixity Information**: Checksums for integrity validation
- **Provenance Tracking**: Processing history, derivation chains

**Three-Stage Lifecycle**:
```
Ingest (SIP) → Archival Storage (AIP) → Access (DIP)
    ↓                 ↓                      ↓
/research-acquire  REF-XXX.md         /research-cite
```

---

#### REF-062: W3C PROV Data Model (W3C, 2013)

**Standard**: W3C Recommendation for provenance tracking using Entity-Activity-Agent model.

**AIWG Implementation**:
- **Entities**: Artifacts (REF-XXX.md, use cases, ADRs)
- **Activities**: Operations (acquisition, documentation, review)
- **Agents**: Researchers, AI agents, tools
- **Relations**: `wasDerivedFrom`, `wasGeneratedBy`, `wasAssociatedWith`

**Provenance Chain Example**:
```
REF-058-aiwg-analysis.md (Entity)
  ← wasGeneratedBy → documentation_operation (Activity)
    ← wasAssociatedWith → research-documentation-agent (Agent)
  ← wasDerivedFrom → REF-058-rlam.pdf (Entity)
    ← wasGeneratedBy → acquisition_operation (Activity)
    ← wasDerivedFrom → https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.09749 (Entity)
```

---

#### REF-060: GRADE Evidence Quality Framework

**Standard**: Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation—used by 100+ organizations including WHO, Cochrane, NICE.

**AIWG Application**:
- **Quality levels**: High (peer-reviewed RCT) / Moderate (peer-reviewed observational) / Low (preprint) / Very Low (blog/opinion)
- **Baseline by source type**: Publication venue determines starting quality
- **Downgrade factors**: Risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, publication bias
- **Upgrade factors**: Large effect size, dose-response gradient, confounding reduction

**Implementation** (planned):
```yaml
# REF-XXX frontmatter
quality_assessment:
  baseline: high  # Peer-reviewed in Nature
  downgrades: []
  upgrades: [large_effect]
  final_grade: high
  rationale: "17,000+ citations, institutional adoption (G20, EU)"
```

---

#### REF-066: Model Context Protocol (MCP) Specification 2025

**Standard**: Linux Foundation Agentic AI Foundation standard for AI-tool integration (10,000+ active servers).

**AIWG Application**:
- **Tools** (actions): `workflow_run`, `artifact_read`, `template_render`
- **Resources** (read-only): Agents catalog, templates, voice profiles
- **Prompts** (templates): Reusable prompt templates
- **Tasks** (async): Agent loops as MCP Tasks

**Server Design Principle**: Single-responsibility (0-3 tools per server) for composability.

---

#### REF-058: R-LAM Reproducibility Framework (Sureshkumar et al., 2026)

**Finding**: 47% of AI workflows produce different outputs across runs without reproducibility constraints. Overhead of 8-12% acceptable for audit/debug benefits.

**Five Reproducibility Components**:
1. **Structured Action Schemas**: I/O specifications for all operations
2. **Deterministic Execution Modes**: Strict (temp=0) / Seeded / Logged / Cached
3. **Provenance Tracking**: Full chain of custody for artifacts
4. **Failure-Aware Execution**: Pre-check → Execute → Post-verify with rollback
5. **Workflow Forking**: Checkpointing for resume/compare

**AIWG Application**:
- **Al checkpoints**: Save state every N iterations
- **Provenance directory**: `.aiwg/research/provenance/`
- **Execution modes**: Agent temperature settings map to R-LAM modes
- **Recovery patterns**: Retry policies, rollback strategies

**Key Metrics** (with R-LAM vs without):
- Output consistency: 98% vs 53%
- Replay success: 99.5% vs 77%
- Debug time: 14 min vs 45 min (median)

| **Citation integrity** | Parametric (can hallucinate) | Retrieval-first (REF-XXX whitelist) |
| **Standards alignment** | None | FAIR, OAIS, PROV, GRADE, MCP |
| **Template library** | User-provided | Built-in SDLC/research templates |

**Summary**: AIWG provides structure, memory, recovery, and standards compliance that base assistants lack.

---

## Known Limitations

AIWG is transparent about limitations to maintain research credibility:

### 1. Evaluation Gap

**Limitation**: Automated metrics (lint, coverage, format compliance) do not correlate perfectly with human quality assessment.

**Evidence**: REF-057 (Agent Laboratory) documents gap between automated evaluation and human quality ratings.

**AIWG Response**: Human gates remain mandatory at phase transitions. Automated validation is necessary but not sufficient.

---

### 2. Token Cost Trade-offs

**Limitation**: Multi-agent review (3-5 agents) costs 4-5× more tokens than single-agent generation.

**Evidence**: REF-017 (Self-Consistency) notes cost increase, but REF-057 shows 84% overall cost reduction with human-in-the-loop patterns.

**AIWG Response**: Cost-aware orchestration—use multi-agent review for high-stakes decisions, single agent for routine tasks.

---

### 3. Incomplete Standards Compliance

**Limitation**: AIWG achieves 8/12 FAIR principles (67%), not full compliance.

**Gaps**:
- Machine-actionable YAML frontmatter (planned)
- Automated provenance tracking (partial implementation)
- License field standardization (planned)

**AIWG Response**: Honest gap documentation in REF-056 analysis. Roadmap for improvement.

---

### 4. Scale Dependency

**Limitation**: Chain-of-thought reasoning is an emergent ability requiring >100B parameter models. Small models (<10B) perform worse with CoT.

**Evidence**: REF-016 (Wei et al., 2022) demonstrates scale thresholds.

**AIWG Response**: Framework assumes access to frontier models (Claude Opus, GPT-4 class). Not optimized for small models.

---

### 5. Reproducibility Overhead

**Limitation**: R-LAM reproducibility constraints add 8-12% execution time overhead.

**Evidence**: REF-058 (Sureshkumar et al., 2026) cost analysis.

**AIWG Response**: Acceptable trade-off for audit/debug benefits. Overhead documented transparently.

---

### 6. Research Corpus Gaps

**Limitation**: Some AIWG design decisions lack direct research backing.

**Examples**:
- 53 agents vs 30 or 70 (empirical, not research-derived)
- Specific phase gate criteria (domain-specific, not generalizable)
- Voice profile representations (novel contribution, no prior art)

**AIWG Response**: Gap analysis documented in `.aiwg/research/research-gap-analysis.md` (planned). Honest distinction between research-backed and empirically-derived patterns.
