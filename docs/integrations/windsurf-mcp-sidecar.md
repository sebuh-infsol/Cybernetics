# Windsurf MCP Sidecar Guide

Connect AIWG to Windsurf Cascade AI as an MCP sidecar for structured workflow access.

> **This is not a standard provider deployment.** Windsurf is an IDE-integrated AI assistant that cannot be spawned from the CLI. The MCP sidecar provides structured AIWG tool access from within Windsurf's Cascade agent. The architecture is `Windsurf Cascade AI → MCP → AIWG Server`. Windsurf supports stdio, Streamable HTTP, and SSE transports for MCP connections, with a 100-tool limit across all connected servers.

---

## Architecture

```
Windsurf Cascade AI (host)
  ├── Cascade conversation and workflows
  ├── AGENTS.md (aggregated agent definitions)
  ├── .windsurf/ (skills, rules, workflows)
  └── MCP connection
        └── AIWG MCP Server (sidecar)
              └── .aiwg/ artifacts, workflows, templates
```

**Windsurf owns**: Cascade conversation context, AGENTS.md aggregation, `.windsurf/` directory, workflow invocation.

**AIWG owns**: workflow execution, artifact output in `.aiwg/`, template rendering, agent role definitions.

**MCP is the seam.** Windsurf already receives AIWG agent and workflow definitions via `aiwg use sdlc --provider windsurf`. The MCP sidecar adds structured, callable AIWG tooling on top of that foundation — without replacing it.

---

## Prerequisites

- Windsurf installed and running ([windsurf.ai](https://windsurf.ai))
- AIWG installed: `npm install -g aiwg`
- A project with AIWG deployed for Windsurf:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
aiwg use sdlc --provider windsurf
```

If you have not done the base deployment yet, complete the [Windsurf Quick Start](windsurf-quickstart.md) first, then return here.

## Install MCP Configuration

Run the AIWG install command to write the MCP configuration for Windsurf:

```bash
aiwg mcp install windsurf
```

This writes (or updates) `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json` with the AIWG server entry.

**Verify the config was written:**

```bash
cat ~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json
```

You should see:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aiwg": {
      "command": "aiwg",
      "args": ["mcp", "serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

After writing the config, restart Windsurf to pick up the new MCP server.

---

## Configure Tool Whitelist

The default config connects to the full AIWG MCP surface. Restrict to the five core tools to keep Cascade's context budget manageable:

**Edit `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aiwg": {
      "command": "aiwg",
      "args": ["mcp", "serve"],
      "tools": {
        "include": [
          "workflow-run",
          "artifact-read",
          "artifact-write",
          "template-render",
          "agent-list"
        ],
        "prompts": false,
        "resources": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Why this whitelist:** Each MCP server exposes its tool schemas into the Cascade context window before any tool is called. The full AIWG surface adds roughly 12,000 tokens of schema overhead. A 5-tool whitelist reduces that to approximately 3,000 tokens — keeping most of the context window available for actual work. See the [Context Budget](#context-budget) section for the full breakdown.

A ready-to-use minimal config template is available at `agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/templates/windsurf/windsurf-mcp-minimal.json`.

---

## Verify the Connection

After restarting Windsurf, ask Cascade to confirm the tools are available:

```text
What AIWG MCP tools are available?
```

Cascade should list the five whitelisted tools: `workflow-run`, `artifact-read`, `artifact-write`, `template-render`, `agent-list`.

**Verify AIWG MCP server runs independently:**

```bash
aiwg mcp info    # Show capabilities
aiwg version     # Confirm CLI is in PATH
```

If Cascade cannot see the tools, check that `aiwg` is accessible from the PATH that Windsurf uses when launching processes.

---

## Run Your First Workflow

Ask Cascade to create a structured artifact that routes through the AIWG MCP server:

```text
Create an architecture decision record for choosing PostgreSQL over MongoDB
for our user service. Save it as a persistent AIWG artifact.
```

**What should happen:**

1. Cascade recognizes this as a structured artifact request
2. Cascade calls `workflow-run` or `artifact-write` via MCP
3. AIWG creates the artifact in `.aiwg/architecture/`
4. Cascade reports the result

**Verify the artifact was written:**

```bash
ls .aiwg/architecture/
```

You should see the new ADR file.

---

## Context Budget

Understanding the token footprint helps you configure the whitelist for your needs.

### With 5-tool whitelist (recommended)

| Component | Tokens |
|---|---|
| Cascade system context | ~2,000 |
| AGENTS.md (aggregated agents) | ~3,500 |
| AIWG MCP schema (5 tools) | ~3,000 |
| **Total overhead** | **~8,500** |
| **Available for work** (128K context) | **~119,500 (93%)** |

### Without whitelist (full surface)

| Component | Tokens |
|---|---|
| Cascade system context | ~2,000 |
| AGENTS.md (aggregated agents) | ~3,500 |
| AIWG MCP schema (20+ tools) | ~12,000 |
| **Total overhead** | **~17,500** |
| **Available for work** (128K context) | **~110,500 (86%)** |

Windsurf has a large default context window, so the absolute impact is lower than on memory-constrained local models. The whitelist still matters for response latency: Cascade must process all schema tokens on every tool-using turn.

---

## Advanced — Enable Prompts

After the basic integration is stable, you can enable AIWG prompt exposure for richer workflow access.

**Update `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aiwg": {
      "command": "aiwg",
      "args": ["mcp", "serve"],
      "tools": {
        "include": [
          "workflow-run",
          "artifact-read",
          "artifact-write",
          "template-render",
          "agent-list"
        ],
        "prompts": true,
        "resources": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This adds AIWG workflow prompts as callable templates from within Cascade. Only enable after the base integration in the previous sections is working reliably.

A ready-to-use full config template is available at `agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/templates/windsurf/windsurf-mcp-full.json`.

## Validation Checklist

Run these checks to confirm the integration is working:

| Check | Action | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| Connectivity | Ask "What AIWG tools are available?" | 5 tools listed |
| Routing (direct) | Ask a one-off question | Cascade answers directly (no MCP call) |
| Routing (artifact) | Ask for a requirements document | Routes to AIWG via MCP |
| Artifact write | Check `.aiwg/` after workflow | New artifact file exists |
| Artifact read | Ask Cascade to read an existing artifact | Uses `artifact-read` |
| Failure mode | Run `aiwg mcp serve` in isolation, confirm it starts | No errors |

---

## Troubleshooting

**AIWG tools not visible in Cascade:**

- Verify `aiwg mcp serve` runs successfully on its own
- Confirm `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json` is valid JSON (use `jq . ~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`)
- Ensure `aiwg` is in your PATH (check `which aiwg`)
- Restart Windsurf after any config change

**Artifacts not appearing in `.aiwg/`:**

- Confirm AIWG is initialized in the project (`aiwg use sdlc --provider windsurf`)
- Check that `artifact-write` is in the tool whitelist
- Verify Windsurf's working directory matches the project root

**Context growing too fast:**

- Confirm `prompts: false` and `resources: false` in the MCP config
- Keep the whitelist to 5 tools unless you have a specific reason to add more

**Config location not found:**

- The config path is `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`
- Create the directory if it does not exist: `mkdir -p ~/.codeium/windsurf`
- Re-run `aiwg mcp install windsurf` after creating the directory
