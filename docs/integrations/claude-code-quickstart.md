# Claude Code Quick Start

---

## Install & Deploy

### Option A: Plugin (Recommended)

Native Claude Code integration - no npm required:

```bash
# Add AIWG marketplace (one-time)
/plugin marketplace add jmagly/ai-writing-guide
# Install the frameworks you need
/plugin install sdlc@aiwg        # Full SDLC framework
/plugin install marketing@aiwg   # Full marketing framework
/plugin install utils@aiwg       # Core utilities
/plugin install voice@aiwg       # Voice profiles
```

> **No account required** - Plugin distribution is decentralized. No registry signup, no approval process - just add and install from any git repository.

### Option B: npm + CLI

For CLI tools and multi-platform deployment:

```bash
# Install CLI
npm install -g aiwg

# Deploy to your project
cd /path/to/your/project
aiwg use sdlc
```

---

## After Installation

**1. Open your project in Claude Code**

```bash
claude .
```

**2. Integrate with platform context**

```text
/aiwg-setup-project
```

**3. Regenerate for natural language support**

```text
/aiwg-regenerate-claude
```

This enables natural language command mapping ("run security review" → workflow). Without it, advanced features won't work correctly.

**4. You're ready.** See the [Intake Guide](../intake-guide.md) for starting projects.

## What Gets Created

```text
.claude/
├── agents/      # SDLC agents (Requirements Analyst, Architecture Designer, etc.)
├── commands/    # Slash commands (/project-status, /security-gate, etc.)
├── skills/      # Skill directories (voice profiles, project awareness, etc.)
└── rules/       # Context rules (token security, citation policy, etc.)

CLAUDE.md        # Project context
.aiwg/           # SDLC artifacts
```

Claude Code deploys all 4 artifact types natively: agents, commands, skills, and rules.

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin Issues

**Marketplace not loading?**

```bash
# Verify marketplace was added
/plugin marketplace list

# Re-add if missing
/plugin marketplace add jmagly/ai-writing-guide
```

**Plugin installation fails?**

```bash
# Check available plugins
/plugin search @aiwg

# Verify plugin exists
/plugin info sdlc@aiwg
```

**Files not found after installation?**

Plugins are copied to a cache directory. If you see missing file errors:

```bash
# Reinstall the plugin
/plugin uninstall sdlc@aiwg
/plugin install sdlc@aiwg
```

**Update plugins to latest version?**

```bash
# Update marketplace catalog
/plugin marketplace update

# Reinstall for latest
/plugin uninstall sdlc@aiwg
/plugin install sdlc@aiwg
```

### General Issues

**Natural language not working?**

```text
/aiwg-regenerate-claude
```

**Commands/agents missing?**

```bash
# npm method
aiwg use sdlc

# or reinstall plugin
/plugin install sdlc@aiwg
```

**Check installation:**

```bash
aiwg version
```

## Agent Loop

Agent loops support multi-provider execution via `--provider`:

```bash
aiwg ralph "Fix all tests" --completion "npm test passes"
aiwg ralph "Migrate to TS" --completion "tsc passes" --provider codex
```

See [Al Guide](../ralph-guide.md) for full documentation.

## MCP Sidecar (AIWG Tooling Layer)

For structured AIWG tool access (artifact management, workflow execution, template rendering), connect the AIWG MCP server:

```bash
aiwg mcp install claude
```

The sidecar complements `--dangerously-skip-permissions` — use both for the full AIWG experience. See the [Claude MCP Sidecar Guide](claude-mcp-sidecar.md) for details.
