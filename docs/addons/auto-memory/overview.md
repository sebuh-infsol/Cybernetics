# auto-memory Overview

The auto-memory addon provides seed templates for Claude Code's Automatic Memory feature. It bootstraps new projects with AIWG-aware memory files so the memory system starts with useful structure rather than empty files, then evolves as Claude Code learns project-specific patterns during development.

## What Automatic Memory Is

Automatic Memory (Claude Code v2.1.32+) maintains persistent, evolving knowledge about your project in `~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/`. Unlike `CLAUDE.md`, which you maintain manually and commit to git, automatic memory is maintained automatically by Claude Code — it adds patterns, debugging strategies, and architectural decisions as it learns them during development.

The distinction between the two:

| | Automatic Memory | CLAUDE.md |
|--|-----------------|-----------|
| **Location** | `~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/` | Repository root |
| **Updated by** | Claude Code automatically | Developer manually |
| **Content** | Learned patterns, debugging history | Static instructions, team conventions |
| **In git** | No — local to each developer | Yes — shared with team |
| **Scope** | Per-developer, per-machine | Team-wide |

Use CLAUDE.md for stable team conventions. Use automatic memory for project-specific patterns that emerge during development.

## The Four Seed Templates

The addon provides four structured seed files:

### MEMORY.md

Central index file. Contains:
- AIWG framework concepts (phases, commands, artifact structure)
- Links to topic-specific memory files
- Empty sections for project conventions that get populated automatically

### testing.md

Testing knowledge structure including:
- Test framework detection and configuration (populated on first test run)
- Common test patterns for the project (populated as patterns are observed)
- Known gotchas — async issues, flaky tests, environment dependencies
- Debug strategies for common failures

### debugging.md

Debugging pattern structure including:
- Common issues and their resolutions (populated as issues are encountered and solved)
- Systematic debugging process
- Stack-specific error patterns
- Performance debugging strategies

### architecture.md

Architectural decision structure including:
- Key design choices and rationale (populated from ADRs and observed patterns)
- Technology stack and justifications
- Cross-cutting concerns (security, performance, scalability)
- Patterns used across the codebase

## How Seeds Work

Seeds are starting templates — they provide structure and AIWG-specific guidance, then fill in over time as Claude Code learns the project. An initial seed looks like:

```markdown
## Common Patterns

<!-- Learned during development -->
```

After several sprints, the same section looks like:

```markdown
## Common Patterns

### Test-First Development

**Pattern**: Test → Implement → Refactor
- Write failing test first (learned from UC-001 implementation)
- Implement minimal code to pass
- Refactor while keeping tests green

**Observed**: 15/20 features follow this pattern (as of 2026-02-06)
```

## Installation

### Automatic (via `aiwg new`)

When creating a new project:

```bash
aiwg new my-project
```

If Claude Code v2.1.32+ is detected, memory seeds are automatically copied to `~/.claude/projects/my-project/memory/`.

### Manual

For an existing project:

```bash
cp agentic/code/addons/auto-memory/seeds/*.md ~/.claude/projects/$(basename $(pwd))/memory/
```

### Verify

```bash
ls -la ~/.claude/projects/$(basename $(pwd))/memory/
# MEMORY.md  testing.md  debugging.md  architecture.md
```

## Memory Maintenance

As the project evolves, memory files may need pruning:
- Remove patterns no longer applicable after refactors
- Mark superseded decisions with "SUPERSEDED" and reference the replacement
- Add new topic files as new concerns emerge (`deployment.md`, `security.md`)

Memory quality degrades if it grows too large (aim to keep files under 500 lines) or contains outdated information. A periodic review (monthly or after major architectural changes) keeps it useful.

## Relationship to Agent Loop Debug Memory

Both mechanisms maintain debugging history but serve different purposes:

| Aspect | Automatic Memory | Agent Loop Debug Memory |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Scope | Project-wide recurring patterns | Single loop execution state |
| Lifetime | Permanent (manually pruned) | Per-loop (ephemeral) |
| Location | `~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/` | `.aiwg/ralph/debug-memory/` |
| Use case | "We always have async test issues" | "Iteration 3 failed with timeout error" |

When the same issue appears in agent loop debug memory across multiple loops, it is a candidate for promotion to automatic memory's `debugging.md` as a known pattern.

## Platform Notes

Automatic memory is Claude Code-specific. Other platforms have their own persistence mechanisms:
- **Cursor**: Project-level memory with a different file structure
- **GitHub Copilot**: No equivalent automatic memory feature
- **Warp/OpenCode**: No equivalent

If you switch platforms, the knowledge in automatic memory files is transferable — copy the content into the new platform's equivalent mechanism, or promote it to CLAUDE.md as static instructions.
