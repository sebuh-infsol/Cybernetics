# prose-integration Overview

The prose-integration addon provides AIWG tools for working with OpenProse programs — Markdown files that use a contract model (`requires:`/`ensures:`) to define precise behavioral obligations. Five skills handle setup, reading, validation, execution, and wiring of Prose programs within AIWG sessions.

## What OpenProse Is

OpenProse programs are Markdown files with contract semantics. They run on Claude Code + Opus via an interpreter spec pattern: loading the `prose.md` specification into context causes the LLM to simulate the Prose VM, which then executes the `.md` program.

The key idea is the word `ensures`. In OpenProse contracts, `ensures:` is an **obligation**, not a description. The model treats it as a commitment that must be satisfied, not a statement of intent that can be approximated.

```markdown
requires:
  - artifact: the document to analyze

ensures:
  - result: comprehensive analysis scoring 85 or higher on the quality rubric

strategies:
  - when score is below threshold: refine and re-analyze

errors:
  - cannot proceed when input is empty
```

## The Five Skills

### prose-setup

Clone or update the OpenProse repository at the configured path (default: `/tmp/prose`). All other skills auto-invoke this on first use — you do not need to run it manually unless you want to trigger an update.

Manual trigger: `/prose-setup`

### prose-reader

Parse a `.prose` or `.md` OpenProse program and extract its contract structure: `requires:`, `ensures:`, `strategies:`, `errors:`, and `invariants:`. Produces a structured summary of what the program needs and what it commits to deliver.

Use this to understand a Prose program before running it.

Natural language trigger: "Read this Prose program," "What does this Prose contract require?"

### prose-validate

Validate a Prose program against the contract grammar without executing it. Checks that:
- Required contract sections are present (`requires:` and `ensures:` are mandatory)
- Each `ensures:` clause is stated as an obligation (not a description)
- `strategies:` conditions are syntactically valid
- `errors:` channels are defined

Use this before deploying or running a Prose program to catch contract authoring errors early.

Natural language trigger: "Validate this Prose program," "Check the Prose contract syntax."

### prose-run

Execute a Prose program within the current AIWG session. Requires Opus (the model must be "Prose Complete" to simulate the Prose VM). Execution state is stored in `.aiwg/working/prose-runs/`.

Single-component programs are the full program in one `.md` file. Multi-component programs use the Forme Container (see `forme-manifest` below) for wiring.

Natural language trigger: "Run this Prose program," "Execute the Prose spec."

### forme-manifest

For multi-service Prose programs: read all service contracts in the program directory and generate the Forme wiring manifest. The manifest maps the dependency graph between components, determining which outputs feed which inputs.

After generating the manifest, `prose-run` uses it to spawn sessions and manage state across components.

Natural language trigger: "Generate the Forme manifest," "Wire up this multi-service Prose program."

## Two-Phase Execution Model

Single-component programs (one `.md` file) skip Phase 1 and run directly.

Multi-component programs use both phases:

1. **Phase 1: Wiring** — `forme-manifest` reads all service contracts and auto-wires the dependency graph. No code, no schema — it infers the wiring from `requires:` and `ensures:` clauses.

2. **Phase 2: Execution** — `prose-run` reads the manifest, spawns sessions for each component in dependency order, manages state, and returns output.

## Auto-Install

All skills automatically install OpenProse on first use. When you invoke any prose skill:
1. Checks whether OpenProse exists at the configured path (default: `/tmp/prose`)
2. If absent: clones `https://github.com/openprose/prose.git`
3. If present but outdated: pulls latest from `main`
4. Verifies key spec files exist (`prose.md`, `forme.md`, examples)

No manual setup required.

## Configuration

Override defaults in `aiwg.yml`:

```yaml
addons:
  prose-integration:
    proseRoot: /path/to/prose/skills/open-prose
    proseStateDir: .aiwg/working/prose-runs
    defaultModel: opus
```

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `proseRoot` | `/tmp/prose/skills/open-prose` | Path to OpenProse installation |
| `proseStateDir` | `.aiwg/working/prose-runs` | Execution state storage |
| `defaultModel` | `opus` | Model for Prose VM (must support Prose Complete) |

## Status

This addon is **experimental** (v0.1.0). The Prose VM spec and Forme Container spec are actively being developed in the OpenProse project. The AIWG integration tracks them.
