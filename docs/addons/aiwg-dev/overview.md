# aiwg-dev Overview

aiwg-dev is the developer toolkit for contributors building AIWG itself — adding new addons, frameworks, agents, skills, and commands to the framework. It is not installed by default and is not intended for end users. Install it explicitly when you are working on AIWG source code.

```bash
aiwg use aiwg-dev
```

`aiwg-dev` is excluded from `aiwg use all` via `"devOnly": true` in its `manifest.json`. This flag tells `discoverAddons()` to skip the addon during bulk deployment. Any addon with `"devOnly": true` follows the same pattern — it must be installed explicitly and will never be included in `use all`.

## What It Provides

### Validation Skills

| Skill | What It Checks |
|-------|---------------|
| `validate-component` | Single skill, agent, or command — completeness, placement, manifest registration, `@file` link classification |
| `validate-addon` | Full addon — all skills, agents, and rules against manifest; orphan detection |
| `dev-doctor` | Full repository health — structure, orphans, placement violations, TypeScript, tests, circular calls |
| `link-check` | `@file` references in distributable source — catches forbidden `.claude/` refs, bare AIWG-core refs, non-normalized `.aiwg/` refs |

### Scaffolding Skills (Devkit)

| Skill | What It Creates |
|-------|----------------|
| `devkit-create-addon` | New addon with `manifest.json`, `README.md`, and directory structure |
| `devkit-create-extension` | New ops-complete extension |
| `devkit-create-framework` | New framework scaffold |
| `devkit-create-agent` | New agent definition with correct YAML frontmatter |
| `devkit-create-command` | New command definition registered in `src/extensions/commands/definitions.ts` |
| `devkit-create-skill` | New skill with `SKILL.md` in the correct location |
| `devkit-validate` | Run all validation checks on the current working directory |
| `devkit-test` | Run the test suite with development-appropriate flags |

### Enforcement Rules

| Rule | What It Prevents |
|------|-----------------|
| `skill-placement` | Skills placed in provider deployment directories (`.claude/skills/`) instead of `agentic/code/` |
| `no-circular-skill-calls` | Skills that invoke themselves via `aiwg <command>` in bash blocks |
| `component-completeness` | Components missing required sections (frontmatter, title, behavior, examples) |
| `addon-boundaries` | Source code mixed with project output (`.aiwg/` content in `agentic/code/`) |
| `aiwg-dir-reference-contract` | Non-normalized `.aiwg/` paths in distributable source (paths that only work in the AIWG repo itself) |

## The Component Validation Model

All validation in aiwg-dev follows the same model: check completeness, check placement, check manifest registration, check `@file` references.

### @file Reference Classification

Every `@<path>` reference in a distributable skill or agent is classified:

| Pattern | Classification | Action |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| `@$AIWG_ROOT/<path>` | PASS | Install-relative AIWG core reference |
| `@.aiwg/<path>` (normalized) | PASS | Project memory reference |
| `@.aiwg/<path>` (non-normalized) | FAIL | Repo-local path — only works in AIWG dev repo |
| `@.claude/<path>` | FAIL | Deployment target — forbidden in source |
| `@agentic/code/<path>` (bare) | WARN | Legacy — migrate to `@$AIWG_ROOT/agentic/code/` |
| `@docs/<path>` (bare) | WARN | Legacy — migrate to `@$AIWG_ROOT/docs/` |

This classification is what the `link-check` skill and Section 4 of `dev-doctor` both use.

### Normalized .aiwg/ Paths

A "normalized" `.aiwg/` path is one that exists (or will exist) in every project that installs AIWG — specifically paths listed in `memory.creates` fields in `manifest.json` files, plus the Tier 1 allowlist (`.aiwg/AIWG.md`, `.aiwg/frameworks/`). Non-normalized paths are repo-local and will break for any user who installs the addon.

## Audience

aiwg-dev is for:
- AIWG contributors adding new addons, frameworks, or skills
- Developers building custom addons that follow AIWG conventions
- Anyone running pre-PR validation checks on AIWG source changes

It is not for end users of deployed AIWG frameworks. End users should use `aiwg doctor` (the runtime health check) rather than `dev-doctor` (the source structure check).
