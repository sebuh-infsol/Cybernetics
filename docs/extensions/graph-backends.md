# Graph Backends

The AIWG artifact index stores dependency and relationship data as a directed graph. The **graph backend** controls how that graph is represented and queried. AIWG ships with a zero-dependency JSON default; optional backends unlock richer queries and larger-scale performance at the cost of additional npm packages.

## The Three Tiers

| Tier | Backend | Sweet spot | Extra deps |
|------|---------|-----------|------------|
| **Default** | `json` | All projects, <5k nodes | none |
| **Optional** | `graphology` | Rich traversal, community detection, <50k nodes | `graphology` + ecosystem (~50KB) |
| **Optional** | `sqlite` | Large corpora, SQL set ops, persistence | `better-sqlite3` (~200KB native) |

A fourth, orthogonal capability — **semantic embeddings** — can be added to any tier for similarity search.

All three tiers produce the same `dependencies.json` output format and support the same `aiwg index` CLI surface. The backend is an implementation detail.

---

## Default: JSON Backend

No configuration needed. The JSON backend is always active unless overridden.

**Capabilities:**
- Typed edges (`{ path, type }` via `EdgeRef`)
- BFS/DFS traversal up to configurable depth
- Set operations (intersection, difference, union) via JavaScript `Set`
- Shell composition for complex queries via `aiwg index neighbors --json`

**Limitations:**
- Graph rebuilt in memory on every `aiwg index` invocation
- Set operations on large neighbor lists are O(n×m)
- No cross-graph SQL joins (compose with shell `comm` instead)

---

## Optional: Graphology Backend

Best for teams that need traversal algorithms (shortest path, community detection) or want in-process graph operators without SQL.

### Install

```bash
npm install graphology graphology-operators graphology-traversal
# Optional extras:
npm install graphology-shortest-path graphology-communities
```

### Activate

```yaml
# .aiwg/config.yaml
index:
  graphBackend: graphology
```

Or per-graph:

```yaml
index:
  graphs:
    citation-network:
      graphBackend: graphology
```

### What you get

- **Typed edge attributes** native to graphology's data model
- **BFS/DFS** via `graphology-traversal` with visitor callbacks
- **Shortest citation path** via `graphology-shortest-path`
- **Community/cluster detection** via `graphology-communities` (Louvain algorithm)
  - "Which citation cluster does REF-008 belong to?"
  - "What are the densely connected sub-networks in this corpus?"
- **Graph-level operators** via `graphology-operators` (`union`, `intersection`, `disjointUnion`)

### Example: citation chain

```typescript
import { bidirectional } from 'graphology-shortest-path/unweighted';

const path = bidirectional(graph, 'REF-001', 'REF-234');
// → ['REF-001', 'REF-008', 'REF-047', 'REF-234']
```

---

## Optional: SQLite Backend

Best for large corpora (5k+ nodes), teams running repeated cross-graph citation queries, or workflows where the graph must persist between runs without a full rebuild.

### Install

```bash
npm install better-sqlite3
```

**Platform note:** Prebuilt binaries ship for Linux x64/arm64 and macOS. Alpine (musl) or non-standard Node versions require `npm rebuild better-sqlite3`.

### Activate

```yaml
# .aiwg/config.yaml
index:
  graphBackend: sqlite
```

### Set operations (native SQL)

```sql
-- Papers that cited both REF-008 and REF-016
SELECT source FROM edges WHERE target = 'REF-008' AND edge_type = 'cites'
INTERSECT
SELECT source FROM edges WHERE target = 'REF-016' AND edge_type = 'cites';

-- Papers that cited REF-008 but not REF-001
SELECT source FROM edges WHERE target = 'REF-008' AND edge_type = 'cites'
EXCEPT
SELECT source FROM edges WHERE target = 'REF-001' AND edge_type = 'cites';
```

These run via `aiwg index query --set-query` or are composed by the `aiwg index neighbors` command when the SQLite backend is active.

### Cross-graph federation

```sql
ATTACH DATABASE '.aiwg/.index/summaries/graph.db' AS summaries;
ATTACH DATABASE '.aiwg/.index/citation-network/graph.db' AS cn;

SELECT s.id, s.title
FROM summaries.nodes s
JOIN cn.edges e ON e.source = s.id
WHERE e.target = 'REF-008' AND e.edge_type = 'cites';
```

### Incremental updates

The SQLite backend writes at the row level — only changed nodes and edges are updated. For large corpora where most files are unchanged between builds, this significantly reduces rebuild time.

### Combining backends

Graphology and SQLite are complementary. A common pattern for research corpora:

```yaml
index:
  graphs:
    citation-network:
      graphBackend: sqlite       # fast SQL set ops and persistence
    summaries:
      graphBackend: graphology   # community detection across summary docs
```

---

## Optional: Semantic Embedding Index

Orthogonal to the graph backend — the embedding index adds a dense vector layer for similarity search. It coexists with any backend tier.

### Install

```bash
npm install @xenova/transformers hnswlib-node
```

`@xenova/transformers` is pure JavaScript (ONNX runtime, no native code). `hnswlib-node` ships prebuilt binaries.

### Activate

```yaml
index:
  embedding:
    enabled: true
    model: Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2   # ~22MB, ~5ms/embedding on CPU
    # model: Xenova/all-mpnet-base-v2  # ~110MB, higher quality
    topK: 10
```

### Model is downloaded once

Models are cached to `~/.cache/aiwg/models/` on first use. Subsequent builds use the cached ONNX weights.

### What you get

```bash
# Semantic similarity search
aiwg index query "dense retrieval for question answering" \
  --semantic --graph citation-network
# Returns corpus papers ranked by semantic similarity to the query

# Semantic neighbors of a specific node
aiwg index neighbors --node REF-008 --semantic --top-k 5
# Returns 5 papers most similar to REF-008's abstract
```

### Corpus size guidance

| Corpus | Model | One-time build | Query |
|--------|-------|---------------|-------|
| 234 nodes | all-MiniLM-L6-v2 | ~12s | <5ms |
| 1,000 nodes | all-MiniLM-L6-v2 | ~50s | <5ms |
| 5,000 nodes | all-MiniLM-L6-v2 | ~4 min | <5ms |

Incremental rebuilds only re-embed nodes whose content checksum changed.

## Module Graph Declarations

Frameworks and addons can declare their own graph configurations in `manifest.json`. This means operators who install `aiwg use research` automatically get `papers`, `citation-network`, and `summaries` graphs — no manual `.aiwg/config.yaml` changes needed.

### How it works

Each framework manifest may include an `index.graphs` section:

```json
{
  "id": "research-complete",
  "index": {
    "graphs": {
      "citation-network": {
        "scanDirs": ["documentation/citations"],
        "extensions": [".md"],
        "edgeExtraction": {
          "parser": "citation-sidecar",
          "edges": [
            { "type": "cites",    "source": "frontmatter.ref", "target": "outgoing-table.inducted-ref" },
            { "type": "cited-by", "source": "frontmatter.ref", "target": "incoming-table.inducted-ref" }
          ]
        },
        "defaultBuild": true
      },
      "papers": {
        "scanDirs": ["pdfs/full"],
        "extensions": [".pdf"],
        "nodeStrategy": "filename-metadata",
        "filenamePattern": "REF-(?<ref>\\d{3})-(?<author>[^-]+)-(?<year>\\d{4})-(?<slug>.+)\\.pdf",
        "defaultBuild": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Operator override

Operator `.aiwg/config.yaml` always takes precedence over framework-declared graphs:

```yaml
index:
  graphs:
    citation-network:
      scanDirs: [my/custom/citations]  # overrides research-complete default
      graphBackend: sqlite              # use SQLite for this graph specifically
```

### Pattern

This follows the same model as `memory.creates` in addons — a module declares its structural contract; AIWG materializes it at install time. Any framework or addon can define graphs relevant to its domain:

| Module | Graphs declared |
|--------|----------------|
| `research-complete` | `papers`, `citation-network`, `summaries` |
| `media-curator` | `recordings`, `releases` |
| `sdlc-complete` | `project` (already built-in) |
| Custom addon | anything in `manifest.json` |

---

## Typed Edges

All backends support typed edges via the `EdgeRef` schema:

```typescript
type EdgeRef = { path: string; type?: string };
// type defaults to 'depends-on' when absent (backward compatible)
```

Edge types in the research domain: `cites`, `cited-by`, `summarizes`, `discusses`.
Edge types in SDLC: `depends-on` (default), `implements`, `tests`, `supersedes`.

Filter by type in any CLI command:

```bash
aiwg index neighbors --node REF-008 --direction in --edge-type cites
aiwg index deps .aiwg/requirements/UC-001.md --edge-type implements
```
