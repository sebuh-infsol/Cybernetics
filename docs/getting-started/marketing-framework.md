# Marketing Framework

You're running marketing campaigns — content, social, email, paid, events. You have a strategy but execution is fragmented. Different people working in different tools, inconsistent brand voice, no structured review before things go out.

The marketing framework gives you a full campaign lifecycle: intake, strategy, content creation across channels, brand and legal review, publication, and performance analysis. Every role that exists in a marketing team has a corresponding agent.

---

## Deploy it

```bash
npm install -g aiwg
cd /path/to/your/project
aiwg use marketing
claude .
```

---

## Starting a campaign

### From a brief or idea

```bash
/marketing-intake-wizard "Q2 product launch for enterprise customers" --interactive
```

The wizard walks through campaign goals, audience definition, messaging pillars, channel mix, budget, and timeline. It generates a campaign brief and strategy document in `.aiwg/marketing/`.

### From existing assets

If you already have some materials and need to build a campaign around them:

```bash
/intake-from-campaign ./existing-assets --interactive
```

Scans what you have, infers campaign intent, identifies gaps, and generates the missing strategy documents.

```

```
/generate-social-content --campaign "Q2 launch" --channels "linkedin,twitter" --tone "professional"
```

### Blog and thought leadership

```
Write a blog post about why we moved from monolith to microservices, written as a practitioner for other practitioners
```

---

## Brand and voice consistency

The marketing framework integrates with the voice framework. Apply a brand voice profile to everything generated:

```
Use the technical-authority voice for all content in this campaign
```

Run brand compliance review before anything goes out:

```
/brand-validate path/to/content.md
```

This checks tone, vocabulary, visual description language, and structural patterns against your brand guidelines.

---

## Legal review

For campaigns making specific claims or running in regulated industries:

```
/legal-clearance path/to/campaign-assets/
```

Reviews for regulatory compliance, claim substantiation, required disclosures, and risk flags.

---

## Performance and analytics

After a campaign runs:

```
/campaign-analytics --campaign "Q2 launch" --period "last-30-days"
```

Analyzes engagement, conversion, and attribution data. The `attribution-specialist` agent models which channels drove actual results vs. coincidental traffic.

---

## Multi-channel coordination

Large campaigns spanning many channels:

```
/campaign-kickoff "Q2 Enterprise Launch" --channels "email,social,blog,paid,webinar"
```

This orchestrates content creation across all channels with consistent messaging, proper sequencing, and cross-channel coordination. The `campaign-orchestrator` agent ensures nothing conflicts and everything reinforces the core message.

---

## Campaign retrospective

When a campaign ends:

```
/marketing-retrospective --campaign "Q2 launch"
```

Documents what worked, what didn't, performance against goals, and recommendations for the next campaign. Builds organizational memory so you don't repeat the same mistakes.
