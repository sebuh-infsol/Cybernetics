## What AIWG Does

AIWG is a deployment tool and support utility for AI context. It copies markdown and YAML source files — agents, skills, commands, rules, templates — into the paths each AI platform reads (`.claude/agents/`, `~/.codex/skills/`, `.cursor/rules/`, and seven more) so one source of truth works across 10 platforms. Around that core, it ships optional utilities the base platforms do not provide: persistent `.aiwg/` artifact memory, multi-agent orchestration, workflow recovery loops, artifact indexing, and cost telemetry.

Unlike simple prompt tools, AIWG gives AI systems the memory to maintain project context across sessions, the coordination mechanisms to synthesize multiple perspectives, and the recovery protocols to handle failures systematically — all expressed as file conventions and deployment rules rather than a monolithic runtime you depend on.

## Business Value

### Risk Reduction

**47% of AI workflows produce inconsistent results** without reproducibility constraints. AIWG implements workflow checkpointing, environment versioning, and execution provenance tracking to ensure repeatable outcomes. Every operation is logged, every decision is traceable, and every artifact can be reproduced from its source inputs.

**Recovery capability—not initial correctness—predicts task success.** AIWG's agent loop system implements structured recovery protocols (PAUSE → DIAGNOSE → ADAPT → RETRY → ESCALATE) that achieve 80%+ recovery success rates. This resilience-first design means failures become learning opportunities rather than project blockers.

### Auditability and Compliance

**W3C PROV-compliant provenance tracking** records who created what, when, and from which sources. Every artifact maintains bidirectional traceability links showing its derivation chain and downstream dependencies. This enables compliance audits, impact analysis, and forensic investigation of decisions.

**FAIR-aligned persistent identifiers** (REF-XXX system) ensure research artifacts remain findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. FAIR Principles are endorsed by G20, EU Horizon 2020, NIH, and UKRI—17,000+ citations validate this approach. AIWG brings research-grade artifact management to software development.

**OAIS-inspired archival lifecycle** (ISO 14721) governs research intake from submission through archival storage to dissemination. This international standard for digital preservation ensures long-term value retention of project knowledge.

### Governance and Quality Gates

**Stage-gate process management** with cross-functional review panels prevents single-perspective failures. Research shows successful products invest 3× more in preliminary investigation than failures—AIWG enforces this investment through rich Inception templates and mandatory gate approvals.

**Quality of execution is the number one success factor** for new product development. AIWG's 50+ templates and multi-agent review gates enforce thoroughness at every phase, ensuring consistent execution quality.

**Human-in-the-loop validation at critical decision points** maintains accountability while enabling automation. AIWG doesn't remove humans from the loop—it optimizes their involvement at high-leverage moments (hypothesis selection, result interpretation, final approval).

### Cost Optimization

**84% cost reduction** through draft-then-edit workflows with human gates. Agent drafts do the heavy lifting, human review provides oversight, automated polish handles formatting, and human approval ensures quality. This hierarchical specialization delivers enterprise-grade results at a fraction of traditional costs.

**Multi-agent systems achieve 8× improvement** over single-agent baselines using the same model. AIWG's 53 specialized agents (architecture designer, security auditor, test engineer, etc.) outperform general-purpose assistants through domain expertise and coordinated orchestration.

**Zero hallucinated citations** through retrieval-first architecture. Generation-only approaches hallucinate up to 56% of references. AIWG's citation system verifies every reference against real sources, eliminating the hallucination problem entirely.

## Key Differentiators vs Simple AI Tools

### 1. Structured Memory (.aiwg/)

**Simple tools forget.** Each conversation starts from scratch, with the AI rediscovering project context from code alone.

**AIWG remembers.** The `.aiwg/` artifact directory maintains requirements, architecture, test plans, risk registers, and deployment docs across sessions. This persistent knowledge store enables continuity, consistency, and institutional memory.

### 2. Ensemble Validation

**Simple tools output once.** A single AI generates content and you hope it's correct.

**AIWG validates systematically.** Primary author → parallel reviewers → synthesizer → final approval. Multiple independent evaluations with synthesis reduce hallucination risk through cross-validation. Research shows multi-agent systems produce 5-10× more consistent outputs than monolithic approaches.

### 3. Closed-Loop Correction (Al)

**Simple tools fail silently.** When tests fail or requirements aren't met, you debug manually.

**AIWG recovers automatically.** Agent loops execute → verify → learn → iterate until completion criteria are met or iteration limits trigger escalation. Recovery capability—not initial correctness—is the dominant predictor of success.

### 4. Standards Alignment

**Simple tools reinvent the wheel.** Custom formats, proprietary structures, no interoperability.

**AIWG aligns with established standards:**

| Standard | Adoption | AIWG Application |
|----------|----------|------------------|
| **FAIR Principles** | G20, EU, NIH, UKRI (17,000+ citations) | REF-XXX persistent identifiers, research management |
| **OAIS (ISO 14721)** | International archival standard | Research intake lifecycle (SIP→AIP→DIP) |
| **W3C PROV** | W3C Recommendation (2013) | Artifact provenance tracking |
| **GRADE** | 100+ orgs (WHO, Cochrane, NICE) | Source quality assessment |
| **MCP** | Linux Foundation (10,000+ servers) | Tool/resource exposure protocol |

This standards alignment means AIWG integrates with existing enterprise systems, supports compliance requirements, and benefits from decades of research investment.

### 5. Cognitive Load Optimization

**Simple tools overwhelm.** They dump entire codebases into context windows and hope the AI finds relevant information.

**AIWG decomposes systematically.** Task decomposition limited to 5-7 subtasks per level, respecting human working memory limits (Miller's Law: 7±2 chunks). Hierarchical chunking enables managing large projects while keeping each decision point cognitively manageable.

### 6. Traceability

**Simple tools lose context.** You can't trace why code exists or which requirement it implements.

**AIWG wires everything.** Bidirectional @-mention links connect requirements ↔ architecture ↔ code ↔ tests ↔ documentation. IEEE 830 and DO-178C traceability principles implemented throughout. This enables impact analysis, change propagation, and compliance audits.

## Research Backing

AIWG operationalizes findings from peer-reviewed research across multiple domains:

**Multi-agent coordination:**
