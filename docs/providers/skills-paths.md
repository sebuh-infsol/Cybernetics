# Provider Skill Paths — Verified Reference

Ground-truth skill discovery paths for all AIWG-supported providers.
Paths are verified from platform source code where available, or from official documentation.

**Issue tracking full audit + fixes:** roctinam/aiwg#766

---

## Universal Cross-Platform Path

`.agents/skills/` is scanned by multiple platforms as a shared convention:

- Codex CLI (primary, confirmed from `codex-rs/core-skills/src/loader.rs`)
- OpenClaw (confirmed from `src/agents/skills/workspace.ts`)
- Warp Terminal (also scans alongside `.warp/skills/`)
- GitHub Copilot / VS Code (also scans alongside `.github/skills/`)

Deploying to `.agents/skills/` is the most portable option if you need a single directory that works across providers.

## Per-Provider Skill Paths

### Claude Code

| Scope | Path | Source |
|-------|------|--------|
| Project | `.claude/skills/` | Official docs |

- Discovery: scans `.claude/skills/` for SKILL.md files
- Plugin namespace: `plugin-name:skill-name`
- Copilot/VS Code source confirms it also scans `.claude/skills/` directly

---

### OpenAI Codex

| Scope | Path | Source | Status |
|-------|------|--------|--------|
| Project | `.agents/skills/` | `codex-rs/core-skills/src/loader.rs` | **Primary (use this)** |
| User-global | `~/.agents/skills/` | `codex-rs/core-skills/src/loader.rs` | **Primary (use this)** |
| User-global | `~/.codex/skills/` | Legacy | **Deprecated — do not use** |

- Source repo: https://github.com/openai/codex (full Rust)
- Current AIWG deployment target `~/.codex/skills/` is incorrect — tracked in #766
- Deploy target should be `.agents/skills/` (project) or `~/.agents/skills/` (user-global)

---

### GitHub Copilot / VS Code

| Scope | Path | Source | Notes |
|-------|------|--------|-------|
| Project | `.github/skills/` | `promptFileLocations.ts` | Copilot-specific |
| Project | `.claude/skills/` | `promptFileLocations.ts` | Also scanned — already visible to Copilot when AIWG is deployed for Claude |

- Source repo: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode (full TypeScript)
- AIWG skills in `.claude/skills/` are already visible to Copilot users without extra deployment
- Deploying to `.github/skills/` is still correct for Copilot-only projects

---

### Factory AI

| Scope | Path | Source |
|-------|------|--------|
| Project | `.factory/skills/` | `docs/cli/configuration/skills.mdx` |

- Source: docs only (no public source code)
- Path not independently verified from source; treat as provisional

---

### Cursor IDE

| Scope | Path | Source |
|-------|------|--------|
| Project | `.cursor/skills/` | Official docs |

- Closed source — path from documentation only

---

### OpenCode

| Scope | Path | Source |
|-------|------|--------|
| Project | `.opencode/skill/` | `packages/opencode/src/skill/index.ts` |

- Source repo: https://github.com/sst/opencode (full TypeScript)
- Note: agents (`.opencode/agent/`) and commands (`.opencode/command/`) are config-only via `opencode.jsonc` — file-based discovery only works for skills
- Skills-only file-based discovery confirmed from source

---

### Warp Terminal

| Scope | Path | Source | Notes |
|-------|------|--------|-------|
| Project | `.warp/skills/` | Official docs | Warp-specific |
| Project | `.agents/skills/` | warpdotdev/oz-skills examples | Also scanned |

- Closed source — paths from official docs and example repos
- `.agents/skills/` cross-platform path likely scanned; needs verification

---

### Windsurf

| Scope | Path | Source |
|-------|------|--------|
| Project | `.windsurf/skills/` | Official docs |

- Codeium — closed source; path from documentation only
- Status: experimental

---

### OpenClaw

| Scope | Path | Source |
|-------|------|--------|
| User-global | `~/.openclaw/skills/` | `src/agents/skills/workspace.ts`, `local-loader.ts` |

- Source repo: https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw (full TypeScript)
- All artifacts deploy to home directory — no project-local skill paths
- Inherits Claude Code SKILL.md behavior including deep subdirectory recursion

---

### Hermes Agent

| Scope | Path | Source |
|-------|------|--------|
| User-global | `~/.hermes/skills/` | `agent/skill_commands.py`, `agent/skill_utils.py`, `tools/skills_tool.py` |

- Source repo: https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent (full Python)
- Discovery: `rglob("SKILL.md")` — unlimited recursion confirmed
- NOT MCP-only for skills; file-based discovery is the primary mechanism

---

## Distribution Mechanism by Provider

Not all providers have a native plugin marketplace. The table below distinguishes providers with marketplace-based distribution from those that use `aiwg use --provider <name>` as the file-deploy adapter.

| Provider | Distribution Mechanism | Install Command / Marketplace |
|----------|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Claude Code** | File-deploy adapter | `aiwg use sdlc` |
| **OpenAI Codex** | File-deploy adapter | `aiwg use sdlc --provider codex` |
| **GitHub Copilot** | VS Code Marketplace for extensions; file-deploy adapter for agents/skills/rules | `aiwg use sdlc --provider copilot` |
| **Factory AI** | File-deploy adapter | `aiwg use sdlc --provider factory` |
| **Cursor** | File-deploy adapter | `aiwg use sdlc --provider cursor` |
| **OpenCode** | File-deploy adapter | `aiwg use sdlc --provider opencode` |
| **Warp Terminal** | File-deploy adapter | `aiwg use sdlc --provider warp` |
| **Windsurf** | File-deploy adapter | `aiwg use sdlc --provider windsurf` |
| **OpenClaw** | File-deploy adapter | `aiwg use sdlc --provider openclaw` |
| **Hermes** | File-deploy adapter | `aiwg use sdlc --provider hermes` |

**Marketplace vs. file-deploy distinction:**

- **VS Code Marketplace** (GitHub Copilot): Distributes Copilot *extensions* — GitHub App-based integrations built with the Extensions API. It does not distribute project-local agent/skill/rule file bundles. AIWG uses `aiwg use --provider copilot` for those.
- **File-deploy adapter** (all other providers): No native plugin marketplace exists for distributing AI framework packages. `aiwg use --provider <name>` writes framework artifacts to the platform's native discovery paths. This provides equivalent capability to a marketplace install and is by design, not a missing feature.
