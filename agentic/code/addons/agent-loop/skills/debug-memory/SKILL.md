# Debug Memory Command

Query, analyze, and manage the debug memory from executable feedback loops.

## Instructions

Manage the debug memory stored in `.aiwg/ralph/debug-memory/`:

### Subcommand: query

Search debug memory for relevant past execution sessions.

1. Search `.aiwg/ralph/debug-memory/sessions/` for matching entries
2. Match by file path, error type, test name, or keyword
3. Display relevant sessions with fix attempts and outcomes
4. Highlight reusable patterns

### Subcommand: patterns

Display learned patterns from past debug sessions.

1. Load `.aiwg/ralph/debug-memory/patterns/learned-patterns.yaml`
2. Show pattern frequency, success rate, and applicability
3. Suggest patterns applicable to current context

### Subcommand: stats

Show aggregate statistics from debug memory.

1. Total sessions, pass rate, average attempts
2. Most common error types
3. Most effective fix patterns
4. Files with highest failure frequency

### Subcommand: clear

Clear debug memory (with confirmation).

1. Prompt for confirmation
2. Archive current memory to `.aiwg/ralph/debug-memory/archive/`
3. Reset sessions and patterns

## Arguments
