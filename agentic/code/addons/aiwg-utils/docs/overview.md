# aiwg-utils Overview

aiwg-utils is the core utility addon bundled with every AIWG installation. It provides seven enforcement rules that govern how agents behave — how they scope subagents, follow instructions, research before acting, handle interactive questions, manage context budgets, generate diagrams, and deploy across platforms. These rules are not optional; they are the behavioral foundation on which all other AIWG components operate.

## What's Included

Beyond the 7 rules, aiwg-utils also provides:

- **5 agents**: `context-regenerator`, `aiwg-developer`, `consortium-coordinator`, `self-debug`, `aiwg-steward`
- **9 skills**: `project-awareness`, `schedule`, `soul-create`, `soul-validate`, `soul-enhance`, `soul-apply`, `soul-blend`, `aiwg-sync`, `aiwg-guide`
- **Platform regeneration commands**: `aiwg-regenerate-claude`, `aiwg-regenerate-warp`, `aiwg-regenerate-factory`, and equivalents for all 9 providers
- **Workspace commands**: `workspace-realign`, `workspace-prune-working`, `workspace-reset`
- **@-mention tooling**: `mention-wire`, `mention-validate`, `mention-report`, `mention-lint`
- **Hook management**: `hook-enable`, `hook-disable`, `hook-status`, `hook-regenerate`
- **Importable prompts**: Core orchestration patterns, multi-agent patterns, reliability prompts

## The 7 Rules

### HIGH Priority

#### subagent-scoping

Each subagent gets one focused task with minimal context. The rule enforces: prompt budget under 20% of context window per subagent, no delegation chains deeper than 2 levels, parallel subagents over overloaded serial ones. When `AIWG_CONTEXT_WINDOW` is set, concurrent parallel count must respect the budget.

Apply when: delegating tasks, spawning subagents, orchestrator fan-out.

#### instruction-comprehension

Fully parse all user instructions before acting. Extract prohibitions first, then requirements, then preferences. Track multi-part requests to completion. On failure, re-read the original instructions rather than guessing. Prevent instruction drift on long tasks by periodically rechecking against the original.

The rule has one absolute prohibition: never override user preferences with "best practices."

Apply when: every user request, multi-part tasks, specification compliance.

#### research-before-decision

Research the codebase, docs, and existing patterns before making technical decisions. The pattern is: IDENTIFY → SEARCH → EXTRACT → REASON → ACT → VERIFY. When an action fails, diagnose the root cause instead of retrying with variations (the rule calls this "whack-a-mole detection").

Apply when: API usage, configuration changes, dependency selection, error diagnosis, import resolution.

#### native-ux-tools

Use platform-native interaction tools (e.g., Claude Code's AskUserQuestion) for interactive questions rather than plain text. One question per interaction turn. Includes a platform capability matrix for all 8 supported providers; falls back to formatted markdown if native tools are unavailable.

Apply when: interactive commands (`--interactive` flag), decision gates, intake wizards.

### MEDIUM Priority

#### context-budget

When `AIWG_CONTEXT_WINDOW` is set, respect the declared budget for parallel subagent spawning. Opt-in directive. Max parallel count scales from 1 (32k context) to 20 (512k+ context) using the formula: `max(1, floor(context_window / 50000))`. Includes compaction guidance and per-subagent output size targets per tier.

Apply when: parallel subagent spawning on constrained systems, agent loop batching.

#### diagram-generation

Diagram generation is a standard output alongside every major documentation artifact. Defines required diagram types per artifact: C4 for SAD, ER for data models, sequence for APIs, DFD for threat models. MermaidJS is the default; PlantUML for C4 and formal UML. Source must be committed alongside rendered output. Maximum 15 nodes per diagram; split into sub-diagrams if more complex.

Apply when: architecture documentation, threat modeling, API design, deployment planning.

#### agent-deployment

Rules for agent definition authoring and multi-provider deployment. Covers: agent metadata structure (YAML frontmatter with `name`, `model`, `tools`, `category`), tool selection guidelines per task type, model override configuration, and parallel execution patterns with agent isolation.

Apply when: creating agent definitions, deploying to multiple providers, selecting tools for agents.
