## Usage Frequency Guidelines

Some words are acceptable when used sparingly (1:1000 or 1:10000 word ratio) but become AI detection signals when
overused (1:100 ratio). Words like "manifest," "revolutionary," and "next-generation" should only appear when they are
truly the most salient option, not as default descriptors.

- "Moreover," → [just start the next sentence]
- "comprehensive solution" → [specific description of what it does]
- "innovative approach" → "different method" / specific technique
- "dramatically improves" → [specific metric]
- "robust" → "handles X requests/second" / "99.9% uptime"
- "manifest" → "show" / "appear" / "create" / "build"
