# Best Output Selection Rules

**Enforcement Level**: MEDIUM
**Scope**: Agent loops and iterative refinement
**Research Basis**: REF-015 Self-Refine
**Issue**: #168

## Overview

These rules enforce non-monotonic output selection - tracking the highest quality output across all iterations rather than simply accepting the final iteration result.

## Research Foundation

From REF-015 Self-Refine (Madaan et al., 2023):
- Quality can fluctuate during iterative refinement
- Final iteration is not always the best
- Peak quality often occurs at iteration 2-3, may degrade later
- Selecting from history improves overall output quality

**Example Quality Trajectory**:
```
Iteration 1: 72% quality
Iteration 2: 85% quality ← PEAK
Iteration 3: 83% quality (degraded)
Final output: 83% (suboptimal)
Best selection: 85% (iteration 2)
```

## Mandatory Rules

### Rule 1: Preserve All Iteration Outputs

**REQUIRED**:
Every iteration's output MUST be preserved until loop completion.

```yaml
iteration_history:
  - iteration: 1
    artifacts:
      - path: ".aiwg/working/iteration-1/output.md"
        content_hash: "abc123"
    quality_score: 0.72
    timestamp: "2026-01-25T10:00:00Z"

  - iteration: 2
    artifacts:
      - path: ".aiwg/working/iteration-2/output.md"
        content_hash: "def456"
    quality_score: 0.85  # Best so far
    timestamp: "2026-01-25T10:05:00Z"

  - iteration: 3
    artifacts:
      - path: ".aiwg/working/iteration-3/output.md"
        content_hash: "ghi789"
    quality_score: 0.83  # Degraded
    timestamp: "2026-01-25T10:10:00Z"
```

### Rule 2: Track Running Best

**REQUIRED**:
Maintain a reference to the best iteration throughout the loop.

```yaml
best_tracker:
  current_best:
    iteration: 2
    quality_score: 0.85
    artifacts_path: ".aiwg/working/iteration-2/"

  update_rule: |
    IF new_iteration.quality_score > current_best.quality_score:
      current_best = new_iteration
```

### Rule 3: Select Best, Not Final

**REQUIRED**:
On loop completion, select the highest quality output regardless of iteration number.

```yaml
selection_algorithm:
  on_loop_completion:
    - compare: current_best vs final_iteration
    - select: higher_quality_score
    - log: selection_decision
    - apply: selected_artifacts

  selection_criteria:
    primary: quality_score
    tiebreaker: earlier_iteration  # Prefer earlier if equal
```

**FORBIDDEN**:
```yaml
# Do NOT simply use final iteration
final_output: iterations[-1].artifacts  # Wrong!
```

**REQUIRED**:
```yaml
# Select best quality regardless of recency
final_output: max(iterations, key=quality_score).artifacts
```

### Rule 4: Log Selection Decisions

**REQUIRED**:
Document why a particular iteration was selected.

```markdown
## Output Selection Report

**Loop ID**: ralph-001
**Total Iterations**: 3
**Selected Iteration**: 2

### Quality Scores
| Iteration | Quality | Status |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| 1 | 72% | |
| 2 | 85% | ✓ SELECTED |
| 3 | 83% | (final) |

### Selection Rationale
Iteration 2 selected because:
- Highest quality score (85% vs 83% final)
- Quality degraded in iteration 3
- All validation checks passed

### Artifacts Applied
- .aiwg/architecture/sad.md (from iteration 2)
```

### Rule 5: Support Manual Override

**REQUIRED**:
Allow human override of automatic selection.

```yaml
manual_override:
  enabled: true
  options:
    - use_best: "Select highest quality"
    - use_final: "Use final iteration"
    - use_specific: "Select iteration N"

  audit:
    log_override: true
    require_reason: true
```

## Quality Scoring

### Scoring Dimensions

Quality score MUST incorporate multiple dimensions:

| Dimension | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Validation | 0.30 | Passes all validation checks |
| Completeness | 0.25 | All required sections present |
| Correctness | 0.25 | Accurate information/behavior |
| Readability | 0.10 | Clear, well-structured |
| Efficiency | 0.10 | Appropriate length/complexity |

### Score Calculation

```yaml
quality_score:
  formula: |
    weighted_sum(
      validation * 0.30,
      completeness * 0.25,
      correctness * 0.25,
      readability * 0.10,
      efficiency * 0.10
    )

  normalization: 0.0 to 1.0
  threshold_for_acceptance: 0.70
```

## Integration with Al

### Iteration Snapshot

After each iteration, Al MUST:

1. **Snapshot artifacts**
   ```bash
   cp -r .aiwg/working/current/* .aiwg/working/iteration-N/
   ```

2. **Calculate quality score**
   ```yaml
   quality_check:
     - run_validation
     - check_completeness
     - evaluate_correctness
     - calculate_weighted_score
   ```

3. **Update best tracker**
   ```yaml
   if quality_score > best_tracker.quality_score:
     best_tracker.update(iteration_N)
   ```

### Loop Completion

On completion:

1. **Compare best vs final**
   ```yaml
   comparison:
     best_iteration: 2 (85%)
     final_iteration: 3 (83%)
     delta: -2%
     decision: use_best
   ```

2. **Apply selected output**
   ```bash
   cp -r .aiwg/working/iteration-2/* .aiwg/output/
   ```

3. **Generate selection report**
   ```markdown
   # Output Selection Report
   ...
   ```

## Degradation Patterns

### Common Causes

| Pattern | Cause | Mitigation |
|---------|-------|------------|
| Over-refinement | Too many iterations | Early stopping |
| Scope creep | Adding unnecessary features | Strict requirements |
| Style drift | Changing approach mid-loop | Consistent prompts |
| Information loss | Summarizing too aggressively | Preserve details |

### Detection

```yaml
degradation_detection:
  triggers:
    - quality_delta < -0.05  # 5% drop
    - consecutive_decreases >= 2
    - validation_failures_increased

  actions:
    - flag_degradation
    - consider_early_stopping
    - preserve_pre_degradation_best
```
