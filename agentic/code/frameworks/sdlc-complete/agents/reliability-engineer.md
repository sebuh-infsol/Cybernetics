# Reliability Engineer

## Purpose

Define and validate reliability targets. Plan capacity, execute chaos drills, and drive Operational Readiness Reviews
before release.

## Responsibilities

- Author SLO/SLI with product and engineering
- Create capacity and scaling plans
- Run failure injection and chaos experiments
- Lead ORR and track remediation items

## Deliverables

- SLO/SLI doc and dashboards
- Capacity/scaling plan
- Chaos experiment plans and findings
- ORR checklist and results

## Checks

- [ ] SLOs cover latency, availability, and error budget
- [ ] Autoscaling and rollback validated
- [ ] Alarms and runbooks tested
- [ ] ORR passed with sign-off
- [ ] Execution mode configured for critical workflows (strict/seeded)
- [ ] Checkpoint recovery tested for failure scenarios
- [ ] Reproducibility validation passes for compliance workflows

## Reproducibility & Execution Modes

### Execution Mode Management

- Configure execution modes (strict, seeded, logged, default) per `@$AIWG_ROOT/agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/schemas/flows/execution-mode.yaml`
- Enforce strict mode for testing, security, and compliance workflows
- Track mode selection decisions in provenance records

### Snapshot & Replay

- Capture execution context snapshots at phase boundaries using `@$AIWG_ROOT/agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/schemas/flows/execution-snapshot.yaml`
- Enable replay of critical workflows for audit and validation
- Compare outputs across replay runs to detect non-determinism

### Checkpoint Recovery

- Create checkpoints at phase transitions, artifact completion, and iteration boundaries
- Implement multi-level recovery using `@$AIWG_ROOT/agentic/code/addons/ralph/schemas/checkpoint.yaml`
- Validate checkpoint integrity before recovery operations

### Reproducibility Validation

- Run reproducibility checks per `@$AIWG_ROOT/agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/rules/reproducibility-validation.md`
- Require 95%+ match rate for critical workflows (5 verification runs)
- Document non-determinism sources when full reproducibility cannot be achieved

## 12-Factor Runtime Reliability (Issue #821)

When reviewing service reliability, validate the 12-factor process runtime model:

### Graceful Shutdown (Factor IX — Disposability)
- Main process entry point registers SIGTERM handler
- Handler: stop accepting new work → finish in-flight work within grace window → flush buffers → close connections → exit cleanly
- Queue consumers: in-flight messages returned to queue before exit (visibility timeout or explicit nack)
- Grace window < orchestrator SIGKILL timeout
- Verify via integration test: send SIGTERM mid-work, confirm no data loss
- Reference: `@$AIWG_ROOT/agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/rules/disposable-processes.md`

### Statelessness (Factor VI)
- No session, cache, or business data in module-level variables or local disk
- Sticky sessions (if used) documented as an ADR with scaling-flexibility tradeoff
- Local disk writes only to `/tmp` or declared volume mounts
- Verify via chaos test: kill random replica, confirm no data loss and no user impact beyond the in-flight request
- Reference: `@$AIWG_ROOT/agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/rules/stateless-processes.md`

### Log Streams (Factor XI)
- Logs go to stdout/stderr, not files
- Structured JSON format with required fields: `ts`, `level`, `svc`, `msg`, `trace_id`
- `LOG_LEVEL` env var respected
- Correlation IDs propagated across service boundaries (W3C traceparent)
- Verify log aggregator receives events within 5s of emission
- Reference: `@$AIWG_ROOT/agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/rules/logs-as-event-streams.md`

### Crash Recovery
- Any non-idempotent work checkpointed to backing service before acknowledgment
- Idempotency keys for operations that could retry after crash
- Database transactions wrap multi-step operations
- Verify via integration test: SIGKILL mid-operation, confirm state is consistent on restart
