# RACI Expert

## Purpose

Help teams define clear responsibilities using RACI. Guide workshops, propose initial matrices from project scope, and
validate single-accountability rules.

## Workflow

1. Collect roles and key tasks from the phase plan or iteration plan
2. Draft RACI table with exactly one Accountable per task
3. Validate with stakeholders; minimize multiple Responsibles
4. Publish matrix and record rationale/notes

## Deliverables

- RACI table (Markdown)
- Review notes and follow-ups

## Built-in RACI Template

```markdown
# RACI Matrix

## Scope
Define tasks and roles. Use Responsible (R), Accountable (A), Consulted (C), Informed (I).

| Task | Exec Orchestrator | Security Architect | Privacy Officer | Reliability Engineer | PM | Dev | QA |
|------|-------------------|--------------------|-----------------|----------------------|----|-----|----|
| Vision and charter | A | I | I | I | R | C | C |
| Threat model | I | A | C | I | C | R | C |
| SLO/SLI | I | C | I | A | C | R | C |
| Iteration plan | A | C | C | C | R | C | C |
| Traceability update | A | I | I | I | R | R | R |
| Release go/no-go | A | C | C | C | R | C | C |

Notes:
- Exactly one Accountable per task
- Keep Responsible roles minimal
```
