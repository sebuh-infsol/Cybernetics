# Architecture Designer: Tree of Thoughts Enhancement

**Enhancement Version:** 1.0.0
**Base Agent:** @$AIWG_ROOT/agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/agents/architecture-designer.md
**Research Basis:** REF-020 Tree of Thoughts (Yao et al., 2023, NeurIPS)
**Issue:** #97
**Status:** Active
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-25

## Overview

This document extends the Architecture Designer agent with Tree of Thoughts (ToT) decision-making protocol for systematic evaluation of architectural alternatives. ToT improves architecture decision quality through deliberate exploration of multiple paths before committing to a choice.

**Core Enhancement:** When creating Architectural Decision Records (ADRs), generate and evaluate k=3-5 alternatives using weighted scoring against NFR-derived criteria, enabling data-driven selection with documented trade-offs.

---

## Enhanced Agent Capabilities

### New Capabilities

1. **Multi-alternative generation** - Create k=3-5 distinct architectural options per decision
2. **NFR-based evaluation** - Score alternatives against weighted criteria derived from non-functional requirements
3. **Quantitative comparison** - Build scoring matrices showing weighted contributions
4. **Backtracking planning** - Define measurable triggers for decision re-evaluation
5. **Trade-off documentation** - Explicit acknowledgment of what is sacrificed in selection

### Existing Capabilities (Retained)

All base Architecture Designer capabilities remain:
- System architecture design
- Technology stack selection
- Microservice boundary definition
- Data model design
- API contract specification
- Deployment architecture planning
- Security architecture design
- Disaster recovery planning

---

## ToT Decision-Making Protocol

### Protocol Activation

The Architecture Designer agent enters ToT mode when:

1. **Explicit request:** User asks for "alternatives evaluation" or "ToT-based decision"
2. **ADR creation:** Any ADR creation task triggers ToT workflow
3. **High-stakes decision:** Technology stack, database selection, architectural pattern choice
4. **Ambiguous requirements:** Multiple valid approaches possible

**Default:** All ADR creation uses ToT protocol unless user explicitly requests single-option justification.

### 5-Phase ToT Workflow

#### Phase 1: Criteria Definition (Pre-Generation)

**Objective:** Establish evaluation framework before exploring alternatives.

**Activities:**
1. Read relevant NFR modules from `@.aiwg/requirements/nfr-modules/`
2. Identify applicable quality attributes (performance, scalability, security, maintainability, cost)
3. Assign weights based on NFR priorities and project context
4. Define minimum acceptable threshold (default: 65/100)
5. Specify critical (pass/fail) criteria if any

**Output:** Evaluation criteria table in ADR

**Example:**
```markdown
## Evaluation Criteria

| Criterion | Weight | Description | Source NFR |
|-----------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Performance | 30% | Sub-100ms API response times | @.aiwg/requirements/nfr-modules/performance.md |
| Scalability | 25% | Handle 10x growth without redesign | @.aiwg/requirements/nfr-modules/scalability.md |
| Maintainability | 20% | Team can modify without expert | @.aiwg/requirements/nfr-modules/maintainability.md |
| Security | 15% | OWASP Top 10 mitigation | @.aiwg/requirements/nfr-modules/security.md |
| Cost | 10% | Operational costs <$5K/month | Budget constraint |

Minimum acceptable score: 65/100
Critical criteria: Security must score 8+ (pass/fail)
```

#### Phase 2: Alternative Generation (k=3-5)

**Objective:** Create diverse architectural options representing different trade-off optimizations.

**Generation Strategy:**

Use one or more of these strategies to ensure diversity:

1. **Pattern-based diversity:**
   - Example: Monolith vs Microservices vs Serverless vs Hybrid
   - Ensures fundamentally different architectural styles

2. **Technology-based diversity:**
   - Example: PostgreSQL vs MongoDB vs DynamoDB vs Cassandra
   - Ensures different technology ecosystem trade-offs

3. **Trade-off optimization diversity:**
   - Example: Performance-optimized vs Cost-optimized vs Simplicity-optimized
   - Ensures different criteria prioritizations

4. **Vendor/ecosystem diversity:**
   - Example: AWS-native vs GCP-native vs Multi-cloud vs On-premise
   - Ensures different lock-in and integration trade-offs

5. **Hybrid combinations:**
   - Example: REST+polling vs WebSocket vs GraphQL subscriptions vs gRPC streaming
   - Ensures creative combinations

**Minimum k=3, Recommended k=5:**
- k=3: Fast decisions, limited exploration
- k=5: Thorough exploration, better coverage (recommended default)
- k>5: Rarely justified, diminishing returns

**Include status quo:** If modifying existing architecture, include "keep current approach" as baseline for comparison.

**Output:** 3-5 option descriptions with implementation details

**Example:**
```markdown
## Options Considered

### Option 1: Microservices with REST APIs
- Service mesh (Istio) for inter-service communication
- Kubernetes orchestration
- PostgreSQL per-service databases
- Event bus for async workflows (Kafka)

### Option 2: Modular Monolith
- Single deployable with clear module boundaries
- Shared PostgreSQL with schema-per-module
- In-process event bus
- Future extraction path to microservices

### Option 3: Serverless Functions (AWS Lambda)
- API Gateway + Lambda functions
- DynamoDB for data persistence
- EventBridge for async workflows
- Fully managed, auto-scaling

### Option 4: Hybrid Microservices + Monolith
- Core domain as microservices (high-change areas)
- Stable features as modular monolith
- Shared API gateway
- Mixed persistence (PostgreSQL + DynamoDB)

### Option 5: Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
- Coarse-grained services (larger than microservices)
- ESB for orchestration
- Centralized PostgreSQL with replication
- Strong versioning and contracts
```

#### Phase 3: Systematic Evaluation

**Objective:** Score each option against criteria with documented rationale.

**Scoring Guidelines:**

Use 0-10 scale:
- **0-2:** Fails criterion, significant issues
- **3-4:** Poor fit, major concerns
- **5-6:** Acceptable, notable compromises
- **7-8:** Good fit, minor concerns
- **9-10:** Excellent fit, ideal

**Evaluation Template (per option):**

```markdown
### Option [N]: [Name]

#### Evaluation

| Criterion | Score (0-10) | Rationale |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| Performance | 7 | Good latency with caching. Network hops add 10-20ms. Service mesh overhead 5ms. |
| Scalability | 9 | Kubernetes auto-scaling, horizontal pod scaling. Well-proven at scale. |
| Maintainability | 6 | High operational complexity. Requires DevOps expertise. Distributed debugging difficult. |
| Security | 8 | Service mesh provides mTLS. RBAC at service level. Attack surface larger than monolith. |
| Cost | 5 | High infrastructure costs. Kubernetes cluster overhead. Multiple databases expensive. |

**Weighted Score:** (7×0.30) + (9×0.25) + (6×0.20) + (8×0.15) + (5×0.10) = 7.05 × 10 = 70.5/100

**Critical Criteria Check:**
- [x] Security (8/10) → PASS (threshold: 8+)

#### Pros
- Independent scaling of services
- Technology diversity possible
- Team autonomy (service ownership)
- Fault isolation between services

#### Cons
- High operational complexity
- Distributed system challenges (debugging, monitoring)
- Network latency between services
- Higher infrastructure costs

#### Risks
- **Risk:** Team lacks microservices expertise
  **Mitigation:** Training program, hire experienced SRE, start with 2-3 services only
- **Risk:** Over-engineering for current scale (100 users)
  **Mitigation:** Begin with modular monolith, extract services later when needed
```

**Evaluate all k options** using this template before proceeding to comparison.

#### Phase 4: Comparison and Selection

**Objective:** Build comparison matrix, identify highest-scoring option, apply context to make final selection.

**Comparison Matrix:**

```markdown
## Options Comparison Matrix

| Option | Perf | Scale | Maint | Sec | Cost | **Total** | Critical Pass? |
|--------|------|-------|-------|-----|------|-----------|----------------|
| 1. Microservices REST | 7 (2.1) | 9 (2.25) | 6 (1.2) | 8 (1.2) | 5 (0.5) | **70.5** | Yes |
| 2. Modular Monolith | 8 (2.4) | 6 (1.5) | 8 (1.6) | 8 (1.2) | 8 (0.8) | **75.0** | Yes |
| 3. Serverless Lambda | 9 (2.7) | 10 (2.5) | 7 (1.4) | 8 (1.2) | 7 (0.7) | **85.0** | Yes |
| 4. Hybrid Micro+Mono | 8 (2.4) | 8 (2.0) | 5 (1.0) | 8 (1.2) | 6 (0.6) | **72.0** | Yes |
| 5. SOA with ESB | 7 (2.1) | 7 (1.75) | 6 (1.2) | 7 (1.05) | 6 (0.6) | **67.5** | Fail (Sec<8) |

*Numbers in parentheses show weighted contribution (score × weight)*
```

**Selection Process:**

1. **Eliminate failures:**
   - Remove options failing critical criteria (Option 5: Security 7 < 8 required)
   - Remove options below minimum threshold (all remaining pass 65/100)

2. **Identify quantitative winner:**
   - Highest total: Option 3 Serverless (85.0)
   - Second: Option 2 Modular Monolith (75.0)

3. **Apply context factors:**
   - **Team expertise:** Strong in traditional web apps, zero serverless experience
   - **Current architecture:** Monolithic PHP app, migration complexity matters
   - **Timeline:** 6-month deadline, learning curve a risk
   - **Vendor lock-in:** Leadership prefers cloud-agnostic where possible
   - **Scale reality:** 1K users today, 10K projected in 2 years (not hyperscale)

4. **Make selection:**
   - **Selected:** Option 2 Modular Monolith (75.0)
   - **Why not Option 3 (85.0)?** Despite higher score:
     - Team skill gap too large (risk)
     - AWS lock-in conflicts with strategy (business)
     - Premature optimization for current scale (context)
     - 10-point difference acceptable given risk reduction

**Output:** Selection with quantitative + qualitative rationale

```markdown
## Decision

**Selected Option:** Option 2 - Modular Monolith

**Quantitative Rationale:**
- Scored 75.0/100 (above 65.0 threshold)
- Ranked 2nd among viable options
- Passed critical security criterion (8/10)

**Qualitative Rationale:**

While Option 3 (Serverless) scored higher (85.0), we selected Option 2 due to:

1. **Team capability alignment:** Strong existing expertise in monolithic architectures, zero serverless experience. Learning curve poses schedule risk.
2. **Migration complexity:** Current PHP monolith maps naturally to modular monolith refactor, not to Lambda functions. Reduces migration risk.
3. **Strategic fit:** Cloud-agnostic architecture preferred; serverless creates AWS lock-in.
4. **Scale appropriateness:** Serverless optimizes for hyperscale (millions of requests). We project 10K users in 2 years. Modular monolith handles this easily.
5. **Future flexibility:** Modular monolith provides clear extraction path to microservices if/when scale demands it.

**Trade-offs Accepted:**
- **Lower scalability ceiling:** Monolith scales to ~50K concurrent users before requiring microservices extraction (acceptable for 5-year horizon).
- **Technology diversity limited:** Single tech stack vs per-service selection in microservices (acceptable given team size of 8 developers).
```

#### Phase 5: Backtracking Triggers

**Objective:** Define measurable conditions that indicate decision should be re-evaluated.

**Trigger Categories:**

1. **Performance failures** - SLA violations, latency spikes
2. **Scalability ceilings** - Growth approaching architectural limits
3. **Operational issues** - Reliability, maintenance burden
4. **Team capability gaps** - Skill shortages, knowledge loss
5. **Business context changes** - Regulatory, acquisition, pivot

**Specification Guidelines:**
- Make triggers **measurable** (not subjective)
- Include **threshold values** (when does it become a problem?)
- Cover **diverse categories** (not just performance)
- Aim for **3-7 triggers** (not exhaustive, but meaningful)

**Output:** Backtracking trigger list in ADR

**Example:**
```markdown
## Backtracking Triggers

Re-evaluate this decision if:

1. **Scalability ceiling:** Active user count exceeds 40K (approaching monolith capacity limit)
2. **Performance degradation:** 95th percentile API response time consistently exceeds 200ms for 2+ weeks
3. **Deployment frequency bottleneck:** Unable to deploy more than 2x per week due to monolith coordination
4. **Team growth:** Development team exceeds 20 engineers (monolith coordination overhead becomes issue)
5. **Feature isolation need:** Regulatory requirement demands strict data isolation between features (suggests service boundaries)
6. **Technology diversity requirement:** Hiring market shifts strongly toward specialized languages/frameworks (e.g., Go for performance-critical components)
7. **Operational cost spike:** Infrastructure costs exceed $15K/month (3x current projection, suggests inefficiency)

**Backtracking Action:** When trigger occurs, re-run ToT evaluation with updated context, constraints, and scale requirements.
```

## ADR Template Integration

The Architecture Designer agent uses the ToT-enhanced ADR template:

**Template Location:** `@$AIWG_ROOT/agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/templates/architecture/adr-with-tot.md`

**Key Sections Populated:**

1. **Context** - Problem statement, constraints, scope
2. **Evaluation Criteria** - NFR-based weighted criteria
3. **Options Considered** - k=3-5 alternatives with implementation details
4. **Option Evaluation** - Scored assessment per option
5. **Options Comparison Matrix** - Weighted scoring table
6. **Decision** - Selection with quantitative + qualitative rationale
7. **Consequences** - Positive, negative, neutral outcomes
8. **Implementation Notes** - Backtracking triggers, validation criteria
9. **References** - NFRs, architecture docs, related use cases

---

## Decision Quality Standards

### Minimum Acceptable ADR

To meet ToT quality standards, an ADR MUST include:

- [ ] **Criteria definition:** Minimum 3 weighted criteria derived from NFRs
- [ ] **Alternative generation:** Minimum k=3 distinct options
- [ ] **Systematic evaluation:** All options scored against all criteria with rationale
- [ ] **Comparison matrix:** Weighted score calculation for all options
- [ ] **Selection rationale:** Both quantitative (scores) and qualitative (context) factors
- [ ] **Trade-off acknowledgment:** Explicit statement of what is sacrificed
- [ ] **Backtracking triggers:** Minimum 3 measurable conditions

### Red Flags (Inadequate Process)

Watch for these indicators of poor ToT execution:

- **Single option presented:** No alternatives explored (not ToT)
- **Superficial alternatives:** Options differ only cosmetically (e.g., "PostgreSQL vs MySQL vs MariaDB" - all same paradigm)
- **Missing scoring rationale:** Scores without explanation (not auditable)
- **Cherry-picked criteria:** Criteria seem selected to favor pre-chosen option (confirmation bias)
- **No context factors:** Selection based purely on scores without qualitative reasoning (naive optimization)
- **Vague backtracking triggers:** "If it doesn't work out" (not measurable)

---

## Alternative Generation Standards

### Diversity Requirements

Alternatives MUST differ in at least one of:

1. **Architectural paradigm** (monolith vs microservices vs serverless)
2. **Technology ecosystem** (relational vs NoSQL vs NewSQL)
3. **Deployment model** (self-hosted vs managed vs serverless)
4. **Trade-off optimization** (performance vs cost vs simplicity)
5. **Vendor/platform** (AWS vs GCP vs Azure vs on-premise)

### Bad Example (Insufficient Diversity)

```markdown
Options:
1. PostgreSQL with pgBouncer pooling
2. PostgreSQL with PgPool-II pooling
3. PostgreSQL with Odyssey pooling
```

**Problem:** All options are PostgreSQL with different connection poolers. No architectural diversity. This is implementation detail selection, not architecture decision requiring ToT.

### Good Example (Sufficient Diversity)

```markdown
Options:
1. PostgreSQL with read replicas (RDBMS, ACID, vertical scale primary)
2. MongoDB sharded cluster (NoSQL, flexible schema, horizontal scale)
3. DynamoDB with DAX (Managed NoSQL, serverless, AWS-native)
4. Hybrid: PostgreSQL transactional + Redis cache + S3 objects
5. CockroachDB (NewSQL, distributed SQL, cloud-native)
```

**Why good:** Represents different paradigms (RDBMS vs NoSQL vs NewSQL), deployment models (self-hosted vs managed), and trade-offs (consistency vs availability, cost vs flexibility).

---

## Evaluation Scoring Standards

### Rationale Requirements

Every score MUST include:
- **What** - What aspect of the criterion is being assessed
- **Why** - Why this score (specific evidence, not vague claims)
- **Trade-offs** - What is sacrificed vs gained

### Bad Example (Insufficient Rationale)

```markdown
| Performance | 8 | Good performance |
```

**Problem:** Circular reasoning. No specifics. Not auditable.

### Good Example (Sufficient Rationale)

```markdown
| Performance | 8 | Achieves <100ms p95 latency for read queries via materialized views. Write operations 200ms due to transaction overhead (acceptable per NFR-PERF-003). Degrades under 10K concurrent writes (mitigation: write sharding). |
```

**Why good:** Specific metrics, identifies trade-offs, references NFRs, acknowledges limitations.

---

## Context Factor Guidance

When higher-scoring option is NOT selected, document why:

### Common Context Factors

1. **Team capability:**
   - Existing expertise vs learning curve
   - Hiring market availability
   - Knowledge transfer risk

2. **Strategic alignment:**
   - Vendor lock-in concerns
   - Technology standardization policies
   - Acquisition/partnership implications

3. **Migration complexity:**
   - Path from current state
   - Downtime tolerance
   - Data migration effort

4. **Timeline pressure:**
   - Learning curve impact on schedule
   - Time-to-market criticality
   - Parallel work enablement

5. **Risk tolerance:**
   - Proven vs cutting-edge technology
   - Operational maturity
   - Vendor stability

6. **Scale appropriateness:**
   - Current vs projected load
   - Over-engineering concerns
   - Future flexibility needs

### Documentation Template

```markdown
**Qualitative Rationale:**

While Option X scored highest (YY.Y), we selected Option Z due to:

1. **[Context factor category]:** [Specific situation]
2. **[Context factor category]:** [Specific situation]
3. **[Context factor category]:** [Specific situation]

The score difference ([X.X] points) is acceptable given these risk reductions.
```

---

## Backtracking Trigger Standards

### Measurability Requirements

Every trigger MUST be:
- **Specific:** Exact metric or condition, not vague
- **Measurable:** Quantifiable threshold
- **Observable:** Can be monitored/detected
- **Actionable:** Clear what to do when triggered

### Bad Example (Unmeasurable)

```markdown
Backtracking triggers:
- If performance becomes a problem
- If the team struggles with the technology
- If costs get too high
```

**Problem:** Subjective, no thresholds, not actionable.

### Good Example (Measurable)

```markdown
Backtracking triggers:
1. **Performance:** P95 response time exceeds 500ms for 7+ consecutive days
2. **Team capability:** >3 senior developers leave within 6 months AND replacements not hired within 60 days
3. **Cost:** Monthly infrastructure cost exceeds $20K (2x projection) for 3+ consecutive months
```

**Why good:** Specific metrics, clear thresholds, time windows, unambiguous detection.

**User:** "Create an ADR for database selection using Tree of Thoughts"

**Agent Response:**
1. Acknowledge ToT request
2. Read NFR modules to establish criteria
3. Present criteria with weights for user confirmation
4. Generate k=5 database alternatives
5. Evaluate each option with scoring
6. Build comparison matrix
7. Recommend selection with rationale
8. Define backtracking triggers
9. Populate ADR template
10. Save to `.aiwg/architecture/decisions/ADR-XXX-database-selection.md`

### User Requests Simple Justification

**User:** "Document why we chose PostgreSQL"

**Agent Response:**
1. Clarify: "Would you like a simple justification ADR, or should I evaluate alternatives using Tree of Thoughts for a more thorough decision record?"
2. If user confirms simple: Create basic ADR without full ToT process
3. If user wants thorough: Proceed with ToT workflow

### User Needs Quick Decision

**User:** "We need to choose a logging framework today - we're blocked"

**Agent Response:**
1. Acknowledge urgency
2. Offer expedited ToT: k=3 options instead of k=5, simplified evaluation
3. Present comparison matrix within 30 minutes
4. Note in ADR that this was time-constrained ToT (may revisit later)

---

## Tool Integration

### NFR Module Reading

Before generating criteria, agent reads:

```markdown
@.aiwg/requirements/nfr-modules/performance.md
@.aiwg/requirements/nfr-modules/scalability.md
@.aiwg/requirements/nfr-modules/maintainability.md
@.aiwg/requirements/nfr-modules/security.md
@.aiwg/requirements/supplemental-specification.md
```

Extract relevant thresholds, priorities, and constraints.

### Use Case Context

For decision tied to specific use case:

```markdown
@.aiwg/requirements/use-cases/UC-XXX-relevant-feature.md
```

Extract performance requirements, data volumes, user expectations.

### Existing Architecture

Review current state:

```markdown
@.aiwg/architecture/software-architecture-doc.md
```

Understand migration constraints, integration needs, existing patterns.
