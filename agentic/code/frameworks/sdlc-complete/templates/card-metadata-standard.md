# Card Metadata Standard

## Purpose

Define a consistent metadata header for all “card” templates so teams can assign ownership, maintain traceability, and
relate cards to their parent templates and artifacts.

## Required fields

- ID: use a prefix plus number (examples below)
- Owner: person/role/team responsible for delivery
- Contributors: collaborators
- Reviewers: approvers/peers
- Team: primary team
- Stakeholders: key non-engineering contacts
- Status: draft | in-progress | blocked | approved | done
- Dates: created / updated / due
- Related: IDs to other artifacts (UC, REQ, DES, CODE, TEST, ADR, DEP, RSK, CR, etc.)
- Links: file paths or URLs to source/related artifacts

## Allowed ID prefixes (examples)

- UC-: Use case (e.g., UC-001)
- REQ-: Requirement (e.g., REQ-010)
- DES-: Design item (e.g., DES-004)
- TEST-: Test item (e.g., TEST-112)
- ADR-: Architecture decision record (e.g., ADR-003)
- DEP-: Dependency (e.g., DEP-007)
- RSK-: Risk (e.g., RSK-005)
- CR-: Change request (e.g., CR-002)
- WP-: Work package (e.g., WP-001)
