# Integration Build Plan Template

## Purpose

Define how components are assembled, validated, and delivered across iterations. Use this plan to align feature teams
and build engineers on integration cadence and responsibilities.

## Ownership & Collaboration

- Document Owner: Integrator
- Contributor Roles: Implementer, Configuration Manager, Test Architect
- Automation Inputs: Iteration backlog, CI/CD tooling configuration, deployment topology
- Automation Outputs: `integration-build-plan.md` including schedule and verification

## Completion Checklist

- Build schedule aligned with iteration plan
- Entry/exit criteria for builds defined and measurable
- Automation, tooling, and environment requirements documented

## Document Sections

1. **Plan Overview**
   - Summarize objectives, scope, and build cadence.
2. **Integration Scope**
   - List components, branches, and configurations included in builds.
3. **Build Schedule**
   - Provide calendar of planned builds with owners.
4. **Roles and Responsibilities**
   - Define integration engineer, feature team responsibilities, reviewers.
5. **Build Pipeline and Tooling**
   - Describe CI/CD tooling, scripts, and environment prerequisites.
6. **Entry Criteria**
   - Specify conditions required before code can be integrated (tests, reviews, documentation).
7. **Build Steps**
   - Outline automated and manual steps per build.
8. **Verification Activities**
   - List smoke tests, regression suites, static analysis, and metrics collected.
9. **Exit Criteria**
   - Define success conditions and artifacts produced (packages, reports).
10. **Issue Management**
    - Detail how build failures are logged, triaged, and resolved.
11. **Communication Plan**
    - Note notification channels, dashboards, and escalation paths.
12. **Risks and Mitigations**
    - Identify integration risks and contingency plans.
13. **Appendices**
    - Include build scripts references, environment diagrams, checklists.

## Agent Notes

- Keep schedule and ownership current; update after each iteration retrospective.
- Link to relevant automation scripts in `tools/` or pipeline repositories.
- Coordinate with Configuration Management to baseline build artifacts and documentation.
- Verify the Automation Outputs entry is satisfied before signaling completion.
- Align build windows with environment reservations to avoid resource contention.
- List automated and manual verification steps to streamline triage.
