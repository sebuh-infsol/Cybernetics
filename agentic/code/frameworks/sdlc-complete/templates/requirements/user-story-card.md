## Agent Notes

### For Requirements Analyst

- Validate story follows INVEST principles (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable)
- Ensure acceptance criteria are measurable and unambiguous (avoid "should work well" - use specific metrics)
- Check that business value is clear and, if possible, quantified ("increase conversions by 10%")
- Verify story scope is appropriate for single sprint (3-5 days of work)
- If story is too large (>8 points), split into smaller stories
- Trace story back to epic, feature, or business requirement
- Progressive disclosure: Focus on Phase 1 during inception, expand Phases 2-3 during sprint planning

### For Test Engineer

- Each acceptance criterion should map to at least one test case
- Non-functional requirements need verification approach (performance testing, security scan)
- Consider edge cases and error scenarios beyond happy path
- Plan for both positive (expected behavior) and negative (error handling) test scenarios
- Identify test data needs early (especially for complex filters or integrations)
- Flag testability concerns during refinement, not during implementation

### For Software Implementer

- Technical considerations guide, not prescribe, solution - use your expertise
- Implementation should satisfy acceptance criteria, not mimic examples
- Consider testability and maintainability in design (SOLID, DRY principles)
- Document non-obvious decisions in code comments or ADRs
- Break story into tasks during sprint planning (frontend, backend, testing, docs)
- Raise blockers or questions immediately, don't wait for daily standup

### For Product Owner

- Prioritize based on value, dependencies, and risk (not developer convenience)
- Ensure story aligns with product vision, roadmap, and business goals
- Be available for clarifications during implementation (max 24h response time)
- Accept or reject based on acceptance criteria, not perfection
- Review and accept stories within 1 business day of completion
- Update backlog based on learnings from completed stories

### For UX Designer

- Provide wireframes or mockups before story enters sprint
- Ensure design aligns with design system and accessibility standards
- Participate in acceptance criteria definition (usability aspects)
- Review implementation before Product Owner acceptance
- Document design decisions and rationale
