## Command Overview

**Purpose**: Expand approved vision into detailed, testable requirements documentation with use cases and non-functional requirement modules.

**When to Use**: After vision document is approved by stakeholders and project has passed inception phase gate.

**Expected Outcome**: Baselined requirements in `.aiwg/requirements/` directory, ready for architecture and design work.

## Standard Operating Procedure

### Prerequisites (Blocking)

**Artifact Prerequisites**:
- [ ] @.aiwg/intake/intake-form.md - Project context, scope, constraints
- [ ] @.aiwg/intake/vision-document.md - Approved business vision and goals
- [ ] @.aiwg/intake/stakeholder-requests.md - Initial stakeholder input

**State Prerequisites**:
- [ ] Inception phase gate approved
- [ ] Stakeholder sign-off obtained for vision document
- [ ] Project team assigned and notified

**Validation**: Before proceeding, verify all prerequisites exist and vision document has approval signature.

### Workflow Steps

**Step 1: Requirements Specialist - Requirements Elicitation**

**Input Artifacts**:
- @.aiwg/intake/vision-document.md
- @.aiwg/intake/intake-form.md (for constraints and scope)
- @.aiwg/intake/stakeholder-requests.md (for user needs)

**Action Sequence**:
1. Load and validate input artifacts:
   - Check vision document has "Approved" status
   - Verify product goals are clear (3-5 defined goals)
   - Confirm target users/personas identified
2. Perform competitive analysis:
   - Research 3-5 similar products/systems
   - Document strengths, weaknesses, differentiators
   - Generate competitive quadrant chart (if applicable)
3. Extract user stories from vision:
   - Minimum 5 user stories in "As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit]" format
   - Prioritize using MoSCoW method (Must, Should, Could, Won't)
   - Link each story to product goals
4. Identify non-functional requirement categories:
   - Review vision for performance, security, scalability needs
   - List NFR categories requiring detailed modules
   - Flag compliance/regulatory requirements
5. Generate Product Requirements Document (PRD) according to schema

**Output Artifact**:
- @.aiwg/requirements/product-requirements-document.md
- Schema: ProductRequirementsDocument (see Output Schema section)

**Available Tools**:
- Web search for competitive analysis
- Document templates from @$AIWG_ROOT/agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/templates/requirements/

**Constraints**:
- MUST NOT specify technical implementation details (defer to Technical Designer)
- MUST include traceability to vision document
- MUST hand off to Use Case Analyst after PRD baseline

**Quality Gates** (must pass before proceeding):
- [ ] PRD follows ProductRequirementsDocument schema
- [ ] All required sections populated (no "TBD" markers)
- [ ] Traceability links to vision document valid
- [ ] Minimum 5 user stories documented
- [ ] At least 3 NFR categories identified

---

**Step 2: Requirements Specialist - Use Case Development**

**Subscription Trigger**: PRD from Step 1 validated and published

**Input Artifacts**:
- @.aiwg/requirements/product-requirements-document.md
- @.aiwg/intake/vision-document.md (for reference)

**Pre-Acceptance Validation**:
1. Verify Step 1 PRD quality gates passed
2. Check for blocking issues:
   - [ ] User stories clearly defined
   - [ ] Product goals linked to stories
   - [ ] NFR categories identified
3. If validation fails:
   - Publish issue to @.aiwg/working/requirements-issues.md
   - Block use case development until resolved

**Action Sequence**:
1. Expand user stories into detailed use cases:
   - Assign unique UC-### identifiers (UC-001, UC-002, etc.)
   - Define primary actors and stakeholders
   - Document preconditions, postconditions, triggers
2. For each use case, document:
   - Main success scenario (numbered steps)
   - Alternate flows (branching paths)
   - Exception flows (error handling)
   - Special requirements (NFRs specific to this UC)
3. Create use case briefs for simple scenarios
4. Create full use case specifications for complex scenarios
5. Establish traceability matrix linking:
   - User stories → Use cases
   - Use cases → Product goals
   - Use cases → NFR categories

**Output Artifacts**:
- @.aiwg/requirements/use-cases/UC-###-[name].md (one per use case)
- @.aiwg/requirements/requirements-traceability-matrix.md

**Quality Gates**:
- [ ] Each use case has unique ID
- [ ] Main flow documented with numbered steps
- [ ] Preconditions and postconditions defined
- [ ] Traceability to user stories established
- [ ] Minimum 3 use cases created

---

**Step 3: Requirements Specialist - NFR Module Creation**

**Subscription Trigger**: Use cases from Step 2 baselined

**Input Artifacts**:
- @.aiwg/requirements/product-requirements-document.md
- @.aiwg/requirements/use-cases/*.md (all use cases)

**Action Sequence**:
1. For each NFR category identified in PRD:
   - Create dedicated NFR module document
   - Document specific requirements with measurable criteria
   - Link to affected use cases
2. Common NFR categories:
   - Security: Authentication, authorization, encryption, compliance
   - Performance: Response times, throughput, scalability
   - Reliability: Uptime, error rates, fault tolerance
   - Usability: Accessibility, user experience standards
   - Maintainability: Code standards, documentation requirements
3. Define acceptance criteria for each NFR:
   - Measurable: "95% uptime" not "high availability"
   - Testable: Specific test conditions
   - Traceable: Links to use cases affected
4. Flag regulatory/compliance requirements requiring validation

**Output Artifacts**:
- @.aiwg/requirements/nfr-modules/security.md
- @.aiwg/requirements/nfr-modules/performance.md
- @.aiwg/requirements/nfr-modules/[category].md (one per NFR category)

**Quality Gates**:
- [ ] At least 3 NFR modules created
- [ ] All NFRs have measurable criteria
- [ ] Traceability to use cases established
- [ ] Compliance requirements flagged

---

**Step 4: Requirements Specialist - Requirements Baseline**

   - All user stories linked to use cases
   - All use cases have NFRs identified
   - Traceability matrix complete

## Post-Completion

After this flow completes successfully:

### 1. Workspace Health Check

Run: `/project-status` or ask "check workspace health"

Verifies:
- Requirements baseline properly published
- No stale drafts in .aiwg/working/
- Traceability links valid

### 2. Common Follow-up Actions

**Immediate Next Steps**:
- Schedule stakeholder review of requirements
- Transition to Elaboration phase (architecture and design)
- Invoke: "transition to elaboration" or `/flow-inception-to-elaboration`

**If issues found**:
- Refine unclear requirements with stakeholders
- Resolve traceability gaps
- Update baseline and notify subscribers

### 3. Expected Timeline

**Before Architecture Work**:
- Stakeholder review: 2-3 days
- Requirement refinements: 1-2 days
- Baseline approval: 1 day

**Total Elapsed**: ~1 week from requirements draft to approved baseline

## Usage Notes

**Token Efficiency in Practice**:

This example demonstrates efficiency patterns:
- **PRD Section 2 (Product Goals)**: List format = 15 tokens vs. prose = 40+ tokens
- **Use Case Main Flow**: Numbered steps = 8 tokens/step vs. paragraphs = 25+ tokens/step
- **NFR Requirements**: Structured template = 30 tokens vs. free-form = 80+ tokens

**Hallucination Prevention**:

Requirements Specialist constraints prevent:
- Technical implementation decisions (deferred to Technical Designer)
- Code/pseudocode in requirements (deferred to Developer)
- Test implementation details (deferred to Test Engineer)

**Quality Validation**:

Handoff validation ensures:
- Technical Designer receives complete, validated requirements
- Test Architect has testable acceptance criteria
- No ambiguity in downstream work

## Metrics Tracking

Track these metrics to validate effectiveness:

| Metric | Target | Rationale |

| Token Efficiency | < 150 tokens/section | MetaGPT baseline |
| Human Corrections | < 1.5 per artifact | MetaGPT baseline |
