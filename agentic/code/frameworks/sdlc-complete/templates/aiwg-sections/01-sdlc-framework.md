## AIWG SDLC Framework

This project uses the **AIWG SDLC framework** for software development lifecycle management.

### What is AIWG?

AIWG is a comprehensive SDLC framework providing:

- **{{AGENTS_COUNT}} specialized agents** covering all lifecycle phases (Inception → Elaboration → Construction → Transition → Production)
- **{{SKILLS_COUNT}} skills** for project management, security, testing, deployment, and traceability
- **100+ templates** for requirements, architecture, testing, security, deployment artifacts
- **Phase-based workflows** with gate criteria and milestone tracking
- **Multi-agent orchestration** patterns for collaborative artifact generation

### Installation and Access

**AIWG Installation Path**: `{AIWG_ROOT}`

**Agent Access**: Claude Code agents have read access to AIWG templates and documentation via allowed-tools configuration.

**Verify Installation**:

```bash
# Check AIWG is accessible
ls {AIWG_ROOT}/agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/

# Available resources:
# - agents/     → {{AGENTS_COUNT}} agents
# - skills/     → {{SKILLS_COUNT}} skills
# - templates/  → 100+ artifact templates
# - flows/      → Phase workflow documentation
```

### Project Artifacts Directory: .aiwg/

All SDLC artifacts (requirements, architecture, testing, etc.) are stored in **`.aiwg/`**:
