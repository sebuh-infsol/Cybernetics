## Document Sections

### 1. Environment Overview

**Environment Name**: [dev, staging, production, qa, demo, etc.]

**Environment Purpose**: [One-sentence description of what this environment is for]

- Development: Isolated environment for active feature development and experimentation
- Staging: Pre-production environment for final validation before release
- Production: Customer-facing environment serving live traffic
- QA: Dedicated environment for quality assurance and acceptance testing

**Environment Criticality**:

- [ ] Critical (production, customer-facing)
- [ ] High (staging, pre-production)
- [ ] Medium (QA, demo)
- [ ] Low (development, sandbox)

**Uptime SLA**: [e.g., 99.9%, 95%, None]

**Data Sensitivity**:

- [ ] Production data (real customer data)
- [ ] Anonymized production data (PII removed)
- [ ] Synthetic data (generated for testing)
- [ ] No sensitive data

**Traffic Profile**:

- Expected requests per second: [e.g., 1000 RPS, <10 RPS]
- Peak traffic periods: [e.g., business hours, 24/7]
- Geographic distribution: [e.g., global, US only, EU only]

**Cost Tier**:

- [ ] Full (production-grade resources)
- [ ] Medium (scaled-down but representative)
- [ ] Minimal (cost-optimized for non-critical use)

### 1a. Tech Stack Parity Matrix (12-Factor X — Dev/Prod Parity)

The goal of this matrix is to minimize drift between environments. Any substitution (e.g., SQLite in dev → Postgres in prod) is a parity violation and requires an ADR documenting the tradeoff.

**Principle**: Same backing service technology in every environment. Scale differs; technology does not.

| Component | Dev | Staging | Production | Parity Status |
|-----------|-----|---------|-----------|---------------|
| Primary database | Postgres 16 (Docker) | Postgres 16 (RDS) | Postgres 16 (RDS, multi-AZ) | ✅ Same technology, different scale |
| Cache | Redis 7 (Docker) | Redis 7 (ElastiCache) | Redis 7 (ElastiCache cluster) | ✅ Same technology |
| Queue | RabbitMQ 3.12 (Docker) | Amazon MQ | Amazon MQ | ⚠ Docker vs managed — justified: easier local dev |
| Object store | MinIO (Docker) | S3 | S3 | ⚠ MinIO vs S3 — ADR-NNN references S3 API parity |
| Email | MailHog (Docker) | SES (sandbox) | SES | ✅ Same protocol, test accounts in non-prod |

**Parity violations (substitutions) must be recorded here**:

| Component | Dev Uses | Prod Uses | Justification | ADR |
|-----------|---------|-----------|---------------|-----|
| — | — | — | — | — |

**Gate**: A tech stack substitution that is not justified by an ADR is a phase gate failure per `rules/config-in-environment.md`.

### 1b. Environment Variable Catalog (12-Factor III — Config)

Every environment variable the application reads must be documented here, grouped by category. The `.env.example` at the project root is the source of truth for variable names; this section states the expected value range per environment.

| Variable | Dev | Staging | Production | Purpose | Required |
|----------|-----|---------|-----------|---------|----------|
| `APP_ENV` | `development` | `staging` | `production` | Environment identity | yes |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `debug` | `info` | `info` | Logging verbosity | yes |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `postgres://dev:dev@localhost/app` | (from secret) | (from secret) | Primary DB connection | yes |
| `REDIS_URL` | `redis://localhost:6379` | (from secret) | (from secret) | Cache + sessions | yes |
| `FEATURE_NEW_UI` | `true` | `false` | `false` | Feature flag | no |

Secrets (credentials, tokens) are referenced here but not valued — the actual values live in the secret manager and are documented in Section 4 (Configuration Management). See `rules/token-security.md`.

- infrastructure-definition-template.md (defines infrastructure resources)
- ci-cd-pipeline-template.md (deploys to this environment)
- deployment-plan-template.md (deployment strategy)
- automated-quality-gate-template.md (promotion criteria to this environment)
- slo-sli-template.md (defines SLOs for this environment)
- operational-readiness-review-template.md (validates environment readiness)

## Agent Notes

This template is tool-agnostic by design. When implementing:

- Create separate environment definition for dev, staging, production
- Adapt resource sizing to environment criticality and budget
- Implement access control using provider-specific RBAC/IAM
- Configure monitoring and alerting using available tools
- Test backup and recovery procedures for each environment

Focus on the WHAT (environment requirements) and WHICH (patterns like parity, promotion criteria), not the HOW (tool-specific implementation).
