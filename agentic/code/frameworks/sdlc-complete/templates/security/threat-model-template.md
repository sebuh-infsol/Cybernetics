| Personal Data (PII) | `Restricted` | `User DB` | Encryption at rest, audit logging |
| Session Tokens | `Confidential` | `Cache/Memory` | Short TTL, secure transmission |
| Business Logic | `Confidential` | `App Server` | Code obfuscation, integrity checks |

## Attack Surface Analysis

### External Entry Points
| Entry Point | Protocol | Authentication | Input Types | Validation |
|-------------|----------|---------------|-------------|------------|
| Web UI | `HTTPS` | `Username/Password + MFA` | `Forms, Files` | `Client + Server` |
| REST API | `HTTPS` | `OAuth 2.0` | `JSON` | `Schema validation` |
| Admin Portal | `HTTPS` | `SSO/SAML` | `Forms` | `Strict validation` |
| Webhook Endpoints | `HTTPS` | `HMAC signature` | `JSON` | `Schema + signature` |
| File Upload | `HTTPS` | `Session token` | `Binary files` | `Type, size, content` |

### Internal Interfaces
| Interface | From | To | Protocol | Security |
|-----------|------|-----|----------|----------|
| API to Database | `API Server` | `Database` | `TLS 1.3` | `mTLS, least privilege` |
| Cache Queries | `API Server` | `Redis` | `TLS` | `AUTH, network isolation` |
| Message Queue | `Services` | `Queue` | `AMQPS` | `SASL, encryption` |
| Service Mesh | `Microservices` | `Each other` | `mTLS` | `Zero trust, RBAC` |

### Trust Boundaries

1. **Internet → DMZ**: Public traffic enters through WAF/CDN
2. **DMZ → Application Tier**: Authenticated requests only
3. **Application → Data Tier**: Service accounts with least privilege
4. **Internal Network → Admin Access**: Privileged access management
5. **Third-Party Integrations**: API gateway with strict controls

## Physical Access Considerations

> **Purpose**: STRIDE assumes a network adversary against a fixed-asset server and is silent on physical attacks. This section forces explicit consideration of physical-access threats. If the system is purely datacenter-bound and operators never carry assets, mark this section "NOT APPLICABLE — datacenter-only" and continue. Otherwise, fill in.

### Applicability prompts

- Is any asset portable (laptops, USBs, mobile, IoT field devices)? `[Yes / No]`
- Is any asset stored unattended (hotel rooms, baggage, shared offices)? `[Yes / No]`
- Are operations performed in shared, semi-public, or hostile environments? `[Yes / No]`
- Are operators identifiable as targets (executives, security operators, journalists)? `[Yes / No]`
- Does the threat model explicitly include a physical-access adversary? `[Yes / No]`

If any of the above is "Yes", the system has physical-access considerations. Use the `security-engineering` framework's `physical-threat-modeling` skill to enumerate threats, and create a `physical-threat-scenarios.md` document at `.aiwg/security-engineering/physical-threats/`.

### Threats in scope (check applicable from `physical-threat-modeling` library)

- [ ] Evil-maid swap of bootstrap / boot media (Threat 1)
- [ ] Thunderbolt / USB-C DMA attack (Threat 2)
- [ ] Hostile USB peripheral / BadUSB (Threat 3)
- [ ] Travel-host root compromise (Threat 4)
- [ ] Coercion / rubber-hose attack (Threat 5)
- [ ] Cold-boot RAM extraction (Threat 6)
- [ ] Hardware implant in supply chain (Threat 7)
- [ ] Side-channel / TEMPEST observation (Threat 8)
- [ ] Visual / shoulder-surfing (Threat 9)
- [ ] Lost or stolen device, no other compromise (Threat 10)

### Mitigation references

- Chain-of-trust mitigations → `chain-of-trust-design.md` (Patterns A/B/C/D)
- Coercion mitigations → `factor-design-rationale.md` (FIDO2 PIN, duress codes)
- DMA/USB mitigations → operational hardening (BIOS settings, runbook)
- Cold-boot mitigations → `secret-handling-runtime.md` (memory hygiene); operational (S5 lock)
- Supply-chain implant → `supply-chain-trust` skill (procurement, diversity)

## Trusted Host Assumptions

> **Purpose**: When the system runs on hardware not under the security team's full control (operator laptops, customer environments, edge devices, "bring-your-own-device"), the host itself is a trust dependency. STRIDE rarely surfaces this; document it explicitly.

### Host control matrix

| Host class | Examples | Control level | What we assume |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fully managed | datacenter VMs, hardened SREs' workstations | High | trusted boot, monitored |
| Partially managed | corporate laptops with MDM | Medium | OS-level controls; firmware not always managed |
| Unmanaged | operator-owned, BYOD, partner systems | Low | only what we verify at runtime |
| Hostile | airport kiosks, hotel computers, partner-supplied devices | None | nothing |

### Per-host-class assumptions

For each host class the system actually deploys to, document:

- **Firmware integrity**: `[managed at HQ / vendor-default / unknown]`
- **OS update policy**: `[forced via MDM / vendor managed / operator-managed / none]`
- **Boot integrity**: `[Secure Boot with operator keys / Secure Boot with OEM keys / disabled / unknown]`
- **Removable media policy**: `[allowlist / restricted / unrestricted]`
- **Network policy**: `[VPN-required / no restrictions]`
- **Operator persona**: `[trained security professional / general user]`

### Mitigations by host class

- **Unmanaged or Hostile** host classes: STRONGLY recommend Pattern B from `chain-of-trust-design.md` (signed live image), so the host stops being a trust dependency.
- **Partially managed** host classes: minimum baseline of Secure Boot with attestation (Pattern C measured boot if TPM available).
- **Fully managed** host classes: standard SDLC controls suffice.

### Open assumptions about host environment

For each remaining assumption, document explicitly:

- **Assumption**: `[e.g., "Operator hardware BIOS is locked at HQ provisioning"]`
  - Why we accept it: `[reasoning]`
  - Owner: `[who validates this assumption stays true]`
  - Compromise impact: `[what happens if the assumption breaks]`

## STRIDE Threat Analysis

Using STRIDE framework to systematically identify threats:
- **S**poofing: Authentication threats
