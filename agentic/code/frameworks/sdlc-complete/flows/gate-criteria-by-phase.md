# Gate Criteria by Phase

## Purpose

This document defines specific, measurable exit criteria for each SDLC phase and the gate review process used to validate milestone achievement. Gates prevent premature phase transitions and ensure quality, completeness, and risk management.

## Overview of Lifecycle Milestones

| Phase | Lifecycle Milestone | Primary Goal | Gate Focus |
|-------|---------------------|--------------|------------|
| **Inception** | Lifecycle Objective Milestone (LOM) | Business alignment | Stakeholder consensus + funding |
| **Elaboration** | Architecture Baseline Milestone (ABM) | Technical feasibility | Architecture proven + risks retired |
| **Construction** | Operational Capability Milestone (OCM) | Product readiness | Tests passing + deployment proven |
| **Transition** | Product Release Milestone (PRM) | Production success | Users adopting + support accepting |

## Gate Review Process (All Phases)

### Pre-Gate Review (1-2 weeks before milestone)
1. Compile all required artifacts
2. Self-assess against checklist (identify gaps)
3. Assign owners to close gaps
4. Schedule gate review meeting (required attendees confirmed)
5. Distribute materials to reviewers (at least 3 days before meeting)

### Gate Review Meeting
- **Duration**: 2-3 hours (depending on phase complexity)
- **Format**: Presentation + Q&A + Decision
- **Required Attendees**: See phase-specific sections below
- **Outputs**: Go/No-Go decision recorded in ADR

### Post-Gate Review
- If **GO**: Baseline artifacts, schedule next phase kickoff
- If **CONDITIONAL**: Document conditions, set re-review date
- If **NO-GO**: Document gaps, plan remediation, schedule re-review
- If **CANCEL**: Document reason, conduct lessons learned

  - [ ] Post-release metrics captured (1 week post-launch)
  - [ ] Metrics trending positive or as expected
- [ ] Business case revisited:
  - [ ] Projected benefits on track (early indicators)
  - [ ] ROI forecast updated (based on actuals)
- [ ] Stakeholder satisfaction:
  - [ ] Executive Sponsor signoff on release success
  - [ ] Key stakeholders satisfied with outcome

### Gate Review Meeting

**Required Attendees**:
- Executive Sponsor
- Product Owner
- Project Manager
- Deployment Manager
- Support Lead
- Operations Lead
- Reliability Engineer
- Key Stakeholders (at least 2)

**Agenda** (Week 2 post-launch, 2 hours):
1. Production stability report (20 min) - Reliability Engineer presents
2. User adoption report (15 min) - Product Owner presents
3. Support handover status (15 min) - Support Lead presents
4. Operations handover status (15 min) - Operations Lead presents
5. Known issues and roadmap (15 min) - Project Manager presents
6. Business value validation (15 min) - Executive Sponsor reviews
7. Lessons learned preview (15 min) - Project Manager presents
8. Project closure decision (15 min)

**Decision Outcomes**:
- **PROJECT COMPLETE**: All criteria met, formal project closure
- **EXTENDED HYPERCARE**: Need more time to validate stability (extend 1-2 weeks)
- **ISSUES DETECTED**: Production issues require additional work (back to Construction)
- **ROLLBACK**: Critical issues, roll back deployment (escalation, executive decision)

### Success Metrics
- **Production Stability**: Zero P0/P1 incidents in first week (target: 100%)
- **User Adoption**: ≥ target number of active users (per product goals)
- **Support Effectiveness**: Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) < target (e.g., <4 hours for P1)
- **Stakeholder Satisfaction**: Post-release survey score ≥ 4/5

### Common Failure Modes

**Production Outage**: Critical production issue within first week
- **Remediation**: Emergency hotfix or rollback, root cause analysis, process improvement

**User Rejection**: Users refuse to use new system, adoption rate low
- **Remediation**: Additional training, usability improvements, stakeholder re-engagement

**Support Overwhelmed**: Support ticket backlog growing, long resolution times
- **Remediation**: Additional support training, runbook improvements, defect hotfixes

**Performance Degradation**: Performance acceptable in staging but poor in production
- **Remediation**: Performance tuning, scaling infrastructure, query optimization

## Summary and Integration

### Milestone Comparison

| Milestone | Phase | Primary Goal | Key Validation | Typical Duration |
|-----------|-------|--------------|----------------|------------------|
| LOM | Inception | Business alignment | Stakeholder consensus + funding | 2-4 weeks |
| ABM | Elaboration | Technical feasibility | Architecture proven + risks retired | 4-8 weeks |
| OCM | Construction | Product readiness | Tests passing + deployment proven | 8-16 weeks |
| PRM | Transition | Production success | Users adopting + support accepting | 1-2 weeks |

### Gate Decision Authority

| Gate | Primary Decision Maker | Required Approvers | Can Veto |
|------|------------------------|-------------------|----------|
| LOM | Executive Sponsor | Vision Owner, Financial Authority | Any required approver |
| ABM | Software Architect | Project Manager, Test Architect | Security Architect, Executive Sponsor |
| OCM | Deployment Manager | Product Owner, Security Gatekeeper, Reliability Engineer | Any required approver |
| PRM | Product Owner | Support Lead, Operations Lead, Executive Sponsor | Executive Sponsor |

### Gate Integration with Templates

Each gate references specific templates that must be completed:
- **Inception**: Intake templates, vision templates, business case, initial risk list
- **Elaboration**: Architecture doc, use-case specs, behavioral specs (realizations, state machines, decision tables, interface contracts), pseudo-code specs, test plan, CM plan, development case
- **Construction**: Test evidence, deployment plan, release notes, runbooks, ORR
- **Transition**: Product acceptance plan, status assessment, support handover docs

### Tailoring Guidance

**For Small Projects** (< 3 months, < 5 people):
- Combine Inception and Elaboration (2-week timeboxed phase)
- Use informal templates (vision-informal, business-case-informal)
- Simplified gate reviews (1-hour meetings)
- Reduced artifact count (focus on critical templates)

**For Large Projects** (> 12 months, > 20 people):
- Add intermediate checkpoints (mid-Elaboration review, mid-Construction review)
- Require formal templates and extensive documentation
- External peer reviews at each gate
- Phased releases (multiple Construction → Transition cycles)

**For Continuous Delivery**:
- Inception and Elaboration once per product
- Construction and Transition per feature/release
- Automated gate validation where possible
- Lightweight gate reviews (automated checklists)
