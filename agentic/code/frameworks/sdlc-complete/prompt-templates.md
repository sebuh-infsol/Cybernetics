# SDLC Prompt Library

Use these copy-ready prompts to drive PLAN → ACT agent workflows across the delivery lifecycle. Each block assumes the
agent has access to the latest artifacts in `docs/sdlc/artifacts/` or equivalent context. When a prompt references an
artifact, seed the agent with the matching template from `docs/sdlc/templates/`.
