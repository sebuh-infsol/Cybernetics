## Reasoning

> Complete this section BEFORE acquisition attempt. Per @$AIWG_ROOT/agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/rules/reasoning-sections.md

1. **Acquisition Strategy Selection**: What's the best way to obtain this paper?
   > [Evaluate options: open access, institutional access, request from authors, purchase]

<!-- EXAMPLE:
Options:
1. Open access: ICLR 2023 proceedings are freely available
2. Institutional access: Not needed (open access)
3. Author request: Not needed (open access)
4. Purchase: Not needed (open access)

Selected: Option 1 (open access download)
Rationale: Most efficient, no barriers, verifiable source
-->

2. **Identity Verification Plan**: How do we ensure this is the correct paper?
   > [Define verification steps: DOI check, title match, author match, checksum]

<!-- EXAMPLE:
Verification checklist:
1. DOI resolves to paper? (https://doi.org/...)
2. Title matches exactly?
3. All authors listed correctly?
4. Publication venue matches metadata?
5. PDF checksum available from trusted source?

All must pass for VERIFIED status.
-->

3. **License Compatibility Check**: Can we legally use this paper?
   > [Assess license terms: commercial use, redistribution, attribution requirements]

<!-- EXAMPLE:
License: CC BY 4.0 (Creative Commons Attribution)
Terms:
- Commercial use: YES (allowed)
- Redistribution: YES (with attribution)
- Modification: YES (derivative works allowed)
- Attribution: REQUIRED

AIWG compatibility: FULL (no restrictions)
-->

4. **Quality Source Assessment**: Is this a trustworthy source?
   > [Evaluate source credibility: official proceedings, author website, repository]

<!-- EXAMPLE:
Source: Official ICLR 2023 proceedings website
Credibility: HIGH
- Peer-reviewed venue
- Official publication (not preprint)
- Publisher website (not third-party mirror)
- SSL certificate valid
- No modification signs (checksum verifiable)
-->

5. **Fixity Planning**: How will we detect future corruption?
   > [Define integrity monitoring: checksum algorithm, verification schedule]

<!-- EXAMPLE:
Fixity protocol:
- Algorithm: SHA-256 (industry standard)
- Initial checksum: Record at acquisition
- Verification: Weekly automated check
- Alert: If checksum mismatch detected
- Action: Re-acquire from source, investigate cause

Storage: .aiwg/research/fixity-manifest.json

## Template Usage Notes

**When to create acquisition report:**
- Immediately after acquiring new paper
- When re-acquiring paper (e.g., after corruption detected)
- When upgrading from preprint to published version

**Acquisition workflow:**
1. Identify paper and source
2. Verify identity (DOI, title, authors)
3. Check license compatibility
4. Download from trusted source
5. Compute checksum
6. Create acquisition report
7. Update fixity manifest
8. Create provenance record
9. Proceed to literature note creation

**Quality checks:**
- DOI resolves correctly
- Checksum matches trusted source (if available)
- No watermarks or modifications
- PDF is complete (all pages)
- Text is extractable (not scanned image-only)

**Anti-patterns:**
- Acquiring papers without license check
- No checksum recorded (can't detect corruption)
- Unclear source provenance (untrusted sources)
- No backup plan if primary source fails
