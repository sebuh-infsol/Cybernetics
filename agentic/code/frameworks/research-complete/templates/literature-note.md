## Reasoning

> Complete this section BEFORE detailed note-taking. Per @$AIWG_ROOT/agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/rules/reasoning-sections.md

1. **Relevance Analysis**: Why is this paper important for AIWG?
   > [Explain how this research connects to AIWG's mission, which components it affects, and priority level]

<!-- EXAMPLE:
ReAct is critical for AIWG because it provides the foundational pattern for agent reasoning loops (Thought→Action→Observation). This directly impacts:
- All SDLC agents that use tools (Read, Write, Bash, etc.)
- agent loop implementation (iteration structure)
- Agent debugging and transparency

Priority: HIGH - Core pattern used throughout framework
-->

2. **Key Insight Extraction**: What are the 2-3 most important findings?
   > [Identify the findings that matter most for our use case, not necessarily what the authors emphasized]

<!-- EXAMPLE:
1. TAO loop structure reduces hallucinations dramatically (56% → 0% with tool grounding)
2. Explicit reasoning traces enable better human oversight and debugging
3. 34% performance improvement on HotpotQA demonstrates real-world value
-->

3. **Application Planning**: How will we apply these insights?
   > [Concrete plans for integrating this research into AIWG]

<!-- EXAMPLE:
- Standardize all agents to use TAO loop (@$AIWG_ROOT/agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/rules/tao-loop.md)
- Add thought protocol with 6 thought types (@$AIWG_ROOT/agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/rules/thought-protocol.md)
- Implement tool grounding in agent loop
- Add TAO logging for agent debugging
-->

4. **Limitation Assessment**: What are the boundaries of applicability?
   > [What this research doesn't cover, or contexts where it may not apply]

<!-- EXAMPLE:
- ReAct tested on question-answering tasks, not full SDLC workflows
- Single-agent focus; multi-agent coordination not addressed
- No discussion of human-in-the-loop patterns
- Performance on code generation tasks not evaluated
-->

5. **Gap Identification**: What follow-up research is needed?
   > [Questions this paper leaves unanswered that we should investigate]

<!-- EXAMPLE:
- How does ReAct scale to long-running agent sessions? (agent loops run 10+ iterations)
- Can reasoning quality be measured automatically?
- How do multiple agents coordinate with ReAct patterns?
-->

### Research Question

> What problem is the paper solving?

<!-- EXAMPLE:
How can we improve LLM reasoning on tasks requiring both internal knowledge and external tool use, while reducing hallucinations?
-->

### Methodology

**Study Type:** [Experimental, Survey, Case Study, Systematic Review, etc.]

<!-- EXAMPLE: Experimental - comparative evaluation across multiple benchmarks -->

**Approach:**
- [Key methods used]
- [Experimental design]
- [Evaluation metrics]

<!-- EXAMPLE:
- Prompting methodology: Interleave reasoning thoughts with tool actions
- Baselines: Standard prompting, Chain-of-Thought, Act-only
- Benchmarks: HotpotQA, FEVER, ALFWorld, WebShop
- Metrics: Success rate, fact accuracy, trajectory efficiency
-->

**Sample Size/Scope:** [N=?, datasets, domains]

<!-- EXAMPLE:
- HotpotQA: 500 multi-hop questions
- FEVER: 500 fact verification claims
- ALFWorld: 134 household tasks
- WebShop: 251 online shopping tasks
-->

### Key Findings (Detailed)

#### Finding 1: [Specific finding]

**Result:** [Quantitative or qualitative result]

<!-- EXAMPLE:
**Result:** ReAct achieves 34% relative improvement over Act-only baseline on HotpotQA (49% → 66% success rate)
-->

**Significance:** [Why this matters]

<!-- EXAMPLE:
**Significance:** Demonstrates that explicit reasoning traces improve performance beyond pure action execution. The reasoning→action→observation loop enables error detection and course correction.
-->

**Evidence Quality:** [HIGH/MODERATE/LOW per GRADE]

<!-- EXAMPLE:
**Evidence Quality:** HIGH - Controlled experiment with clear baselines, multiple tasks, reproducible methodology
-->

**Application to AIWG:**

<!-- EXAMPLE:
**Application to AIWG:**
- Implement TAO loop in all tool-using agents
- Track thought types (goal, progress, extraction, reasoning, exception, synthesis)
- Enable iteration-level debugging via thought logs
-->

#### Finding 2: [Specific finding]

[Repeat structure from Finding 1]

<!-- EXAMPLE:
**Result:** ReAct reduces hallucinations to 0% on FEVER (vs 56% for baseline), with tool grounding
**Significance:** External tool use provides factual grounding that prevents fabrication
**Evidence Quality:** HIGH - Clear metrics, multiple evaluations
**Application to AIWG:** Require agents to ground claims in tool observations (Read, Grep results)
-->

## Personal Notes & Insights

> Space for open-ended observations, questions, and connections

<!-- EXAMPLE:
This paper is the foundation for agent transparency. The TAO loop makes agent thinking visible, which is critical for debugging and trust.

Question: Can we extend TAO to multi-agent conversations? Each agent maintains TAO, but how do they coordinate?

Insight: The thought types in @$AIWG_ROOT/agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/rules/thought-protocol.md map well to different TAO phases:
- Goal/Progress thoughts → Pre-action planning
- Extraction/Reasoning thoughts → Post-observation analysis
- Exception thoughts → Error detection in observation
- Synthesis thoughts → Task completion assessment

Need to investigate: How does TAO scale to 10+ iteration loops in Al? Does reasoning quality degrade?
