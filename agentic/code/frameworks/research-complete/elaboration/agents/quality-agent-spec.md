# Agent Specification: Quality Agent

## 1. Agent Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Name** | Quality Agent |
| **ID** | research-quality-agent |
| **Purpose** | Assess source quality using GRADE framework, validate FAIR compliance, generate quality reports, and enforce quality gates |
| **Lifecycle Stage** | Cross-cutting (integrated with Documentation, Integration stages) |
| **Model** | sonnet |
| **Version** | 1.0.0 |
| **Status** | Draft |

### Description

The Quality Agent ensures research integrity by systematically evaluating sources using established frameworks. It calculates multi-dimensional quality scores (authority, currency, accuracy, coverage, objectivity), applies GRADE methodology for evidence assessment, validates FAIR principles for data quality, and generates actionable quality reports with recommendations. The agent serves as a quality gate, flagging low-quality sources and recommending alternatives.

## 11. Related Use Cases

| Use Case | Relationship | Description |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| UC-RF-006 | Primary | Assess Source Quality |
| UC-RF-003 | Upstream | Document Research Paper (provides metadata) |
| UC-RF-008 | Orchestrated | Execute Research Workflow (quality gate) |
| UC-RF-001 | Downstream | Discover Research Papers (quality filtering) |

## 12. Implementation Notes

### Architecture Considerations

1. **Deterministic Scoring**: Same inputs always produce same scores
2. **Configurable Weights**: Allow domain-specific weight adjustment
3. **Extensible Dimensions**: Support custom quality dimensions
4. **Caching**: Cache citation counts to reduce API calls

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Parallel API Calls**: Fetch citations for multiple sources concurrently
2. **Batch Processing**: Process multiple sources in single pass
3. **Incremental Assessment**: Only re-assess changed metadata
4. **Result Caching**: Cache API responses with TTL

### Security Considerations

1. **No Data Modification**: Quality agent only reads and reports
2. **API Rate Limiting**: Respect external API rate limits
3. **Metadata Integrity**: Don't trust unvalidated metadata

### Testing Strategy

| Test Type | Coverage Target | Focus Areas |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| Unit Tests | 80% | Scoring algorithms, GRADE logic |
| Integration Tests | 70% | API interaction, report generation |
| E2E Tests | Key workflows | Full assessment workflow |

### Known Limitations

1. **Citation Lag**: New papers may lack citation data
2. **Venue Coverage**: Not all venues have tier rankings
3. **Subjective Elements**: Some quality aspects require human judgment
4. **API Dependencies**: External APIs may be unavailable
