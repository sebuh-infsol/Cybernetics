## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Purpose

This document specifies the non-functional requirements (NFRs) for the AIWG Research Framework, defining quality attributes, performance targets, compliance standards, and operational constraints that govern how the system performs its functions rather than what functions it performs.

### 1.2 Scope

**Covered NFR Categories**:
- Performance (response times, throughput, scalability)
- Reliability (uptime, data integrity, recovery)
- Security (API key protection, data privacy, input validation)
- Usability (learning curve, error messages, documentation)
- Maintainability (code quality, test coverage, documentation standards)
- Compatibility (AIWG integration, external tool support, standards compliance)
- Compliance (FAIR principles, W3C PROV, OAIS alignment)

**Out of Scope**:
- Functional requirements (what system does) - covered in use cases
- Implementation details - covered in architecture document
- Test cases - covered in test strategy

## 12. Validation Approach

### 12.1 NFR Validation Methods

| NFR Category | Validation Method | Frequency | Responsible |
|--------------|------------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Performance** | Automated benchmarks, load testing | Every release | Developer |
| **Scalability** | Synthetic corpus testing (100, 500, 1K papers) | Monthly, pre-release | Developer |
| **Reliability** | Fault injection, integrity checks | Every release | Developer |
| **Security** | Security audit, penetration testing | Quarterly, pre-release | Developer + Community |
| **Usability** | User testing (n=10), surveys | End of elaboration, transition | Developer + Users |
| **Maintainability** | Automated code quality metrics (SonarQube) | Every commit | CI/CD |
| **Compatibility** | Integration testing with external tools | Every release | Developer |
| **Compliance** | F-UJI assessment, PROV validation | End of construction, pre-release | Developer + Expert Review |

### 12.2 Acceptance Criteria Tracking

**Artifact**: `.aiwg/flows/research-framework/elaboration/nfr/nfr-acceptance-tracking.md`

Track acceptance criteria completion for each NFR:
- [ ] Criteria defined
- [ ] Measurement method implemented
- [ ] Automated tests written (if applicable)
- [ ] Manual testing completed (if applicable)
- [ ] Results documented
- [ ] Criteria met (pass/fail)

### 12.3 NFR Review Gates

**Elaboration Phase Gate**:
- Review: Performance, Usability NFRs (critical for adoption)
- Decision: Proceed to construction if user testing shows <1 hour learning curve

**Construction Phase Gate**:
- Review: Reliability, Security, Maintainability NFRs
- Decision: Proceed to transition if test coverage ≥90%, security audit clean

**Transition Phase Gate**:
- Review: Compliance NFRs (FAIR, PROV, OAIS)
- Decision: Release v1.0 if FAIR compliance ≥90%, PROV validation passes

---

## 13. NFR Priority Justification

### 13.1 Must Have NFRs (Critical for v1.0)

**Why These Are Non-Negotiable**:
1. **Performance (P-001, P-002, P-005)**: Vision promise of 60% time savings depends on fast operations
2. **Reliability (R-001, R-002)**: Data integrity and error resilience foundational for trust
3. **Security (SEC-001, SEC-003)**: API key exposure or injection attacks would be catastrophic
4. **Usability (U-001, U-002, U-003)**: Learning curve and documentation quality determine adoption success
5. **Maintainability (M-001, M-002, M-003)**: Solo developer context requires high-quality, well-tested code
6. **Compatibility (C-001, C-003, C-004)**: AIWG integration and FAIR compliance core to value proposition
7. **FAIR Compliance (CMP-001 through CMP-005, CMP-009, CMP-010, CMP-011)**: 100% FAIR compliance is vision goal

**Consequences of Failure**: If any Must Have NFR unmet, framework not viable for release (user adoption fails, data integrity compromised, or strategic goals unmet).

### 13.2 Should Have NFRs (Important but Not Blocking)

**Why These Are High Priority But Deferrable**:
1. **Performance (P-003)**, **Scalability (S-002, S-003)**: Nice to have, but workarounds exist (sequential operations, manual pruning)
2. **Reliability (R-003)**: Backup important but Git provides basic version control
3. **Security (SEC-002)**: Privacy warnings important but low likelihood of incidents
4. **Usability (U-004)**: Tiered complexity nice but can add post-v1.0
5. **Maintainability (M-004)**: Semantic versioning important but not blocking functionality
6. **Compatibility (C-002)**: Zotero/Obsidian integration valuable but not critical (BibTeX export sufficient)
7. **FAIR/PROV (CMP-006, CMP-007, CMP-012, CMP-013, CMP-014)**: Advanced compliance features enhance credibility but not required for basic FAIR

**Fallback Plan**: If timeline pressure, defer Should Have to v1.1 and document as known limitations.

### 13.3 Could Have NFRs (Desirable but Optional)

**Why These Are Lowest Priority**:
1. **Performance (P-004)**: Knowledge graphs optional feature
2. **Scalability (S-003)**: Storage monitoring nice but users can check manually
3. **Security (SEC-004)**: Malicious PDFs very low risk
4. **Compliance (CMP-008, CMP-015)**: Controlled vocabularies and OAIS advanced features
5. **Cross-Cutting (X-003)**: Web accessibility only if web UI built

**Decision Rule**: Implement if time allows, cut if timeline slippage. No impact on core value proposition.

### 13.4 Won't Have NFRs (Explicitly Out of Scope)

**Why These Are Deferred**:
1. **Internationalization (X-002)**: English-only assumption reduces complexity, i18n deferred to v1.1+ based on demand

By prioritizing NFRs aligned with vision goals (60% time savings, 100% FAIR compliance, 99%+ citation accuracy, <1 hour learning curve), mitigating identified risks (LLM hallucination, manual effort, steep learning curve, capacity constraints), and ensuring compliance with academic standards (FAIR, PROV, OAIS), the framework will deliver a robust, trustworthy, and usable solution for research management.

**Key Success Criteria**:
- Performance: Fast enough to deliver promised time savings
- Reliability: Trustworthy enough to stake research credibility on
- Security: Safe enough to handle sensitive research data
- Usability: Simple enough for developers, rigorous enough for academics
- Maintainability: Sustainable for solo developer long-term
- Compatibility: Integrates with AIWG and external research tools
- Compliance: Meets academic standards without manual overhead

**Risk Mitigation Summary**:
- **T-01 (LLM Hallucination)**: NFR-RF-R-002 (data integrity), NFR-RF-P-005 (validation)
- **A-04 (Manual Effort)**: NFR-RF-P-001, P-002, P-005 (automation speed)
- **R-01 (Capacity)**: NFR-RF-M-001, M-002, M-003 (code quality, testing)
- **Q-01 (Quality)**: NFR-RF-CMP-001 through CMP-015 (FAIR compliance)
