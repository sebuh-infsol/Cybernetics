**Research Document**: @.aiwg/research/research-framework-findings.md

## Metadata

- **Project Name**: AIWG Research Framework
- **Framework Location**: `agentic/code/frameworks/research-complete/`
- **Repository**: https://github.com/jmagly/ai-writing-guide.git
- **Related Systems**: research-papers repo (shared corpus), matric-memory (professionalization use case), matric-eval (benchmarking use case)
- **Project Sponsor**: Joseph Magly (AIWG maintainer)
- **Stakeholders**:
  - **Primary**: Solo researchers, academic teams using AI for literature review
  - **Secondary**: AIWG framework maintainers, matric-* ecosystem projects
  - **Tertiary**: Open science community, reproducibility advocates

## 1. Project Overview

### Purpose

Create a comprehensive framework for managing the full research lifecycle from discovery through archival, with emphasis on:
- AI-powered literature review automation
- FAIR-compliant data management
- Reproducibility and provenance tracking
- Citation network analysis
- Quality assessment and evidence grading

### Problem Statement

**Current Pain Points** (identified from matric-memory #154, #155 and broader research):

1. **Manual PDF Management**: Researchers manually download, organize, rename PDFs with ad-hoc filing systems
2. **Manual Gap Analysis**: No automated detection of research gaps or missing citations
3. **Ad-hoc Organization**: Research notes scattered across tools (Notion, Obsidian, files) without systematic structure
4. **No Automated Discovery**: Must manually search databases, no AI-assisted exploration of citation networks
5. **Claims Without Citations**: Documentation contains assertions without backing research (citable-claims-index.md pattern exists but manual)
6. **Reproducibility Crisis**: 46% replication success rate in cancer studies; researchers lack tools to ensure their work is reproducible
7. **Quality Assessment Gaps**: No systematic evaluation of source quality or evidence strength
8. **Provenance Tracking**: Limited ability to trace research decisions and transformations
9. **Collaboration Friction**: Difficult to share research corpus and maintain consistency across team members
10. **Professionalization Needs**: Projects like matric-memory need to transition from informal to professionally-cited documentation

### Proposed Solution

Build `agentic/code/frameworks/research-complete/` as a comprehensive framework that:

1. **Automates Discovery**: Integration with Semantic Scholar, Research Rabbit, Connected Papers for AI-powered paper discovery
2. **Manages Acquisition**: FAIR-compliant PDF management, metadata extraction, Zotero integration
3. **Structures Documentation**: Zettelkasten-inspired note-taking (literature notes + permanent notes), Maps of Content
4. **Tracks Provenance**: W3C PROV-compatible tracking of all research operations and transformations
5. **Assesses Quality**: GRADE-inspired evidence grading, FAIR compliance scoring, reproducibility assessment
6. **Builds Networks**: Citation network analysis, knowledge graph construction, author/concept relationship mapping
7. **Ensures Reproducibility**: R-LAM-inspired deterministic workflows, PRISMA-style search strategies, preregistration support
8. **Enables Collaboration**: Shared corpus management (research-papers repo pattern), team synchronization
9. **Archives Research**: OAIS-inspired preservation with SIP/AIP/DIP lifecycle management

### Target Users

1. **Solo Researchers**: Academics, independent researchers conducting literature reviews
2. **Academic Teams**: Research groups needing shared corpus and collaboration workflows
3. **Open Science Advocates**: Researchers prioritizing reproducibility and FAIR principles
4. **Matric Ecosystem Projects**: matric-memory (professionalization), matric-eval (benchmarking), other projects needing research foundation
5. **AIWG Self-Improvement**: Framework development itself requires research on AI agents, LLMs, software development methodologies

## 2. Scope

## 4. Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints

**Technical Constraints**:
1. **API Rate Limits**: Semantic Scholar API has rate limits (must implement caching/throttling)
2. **LLM Context Windows**: Large PDFs may exceed context limits (need chunking strategies)
3. **Local Storage**: Large PDF corpus requires significant disk space (100s of MB to GBs)
4. **Processing Power**: Citation network analysis and knowledge graph construction computationally intensive
5. **Network Dependency**: Discovery and acquisition require internet connectivity

**Resource Constraints**:
1. **Solo Developer**: Initial development by single maintainer (limits velocity)
2. **Open Source**: No budget for commercial APIs or services (must use free/open alternatives)
3. **Time**: Target v1 release within 2-3 months (focused scope)

**Compatibility Constraints**:
1. **Platform**: Must work on Linux, macOS, Windows (cross-platform Node.js/Bash)
2. **LLM Platforms**: Primary target Claude Code, secondary support for OpenAI/Codex/others
3. **Standards**: Must adhere to FAIR, PROV, OAIS, GRADE standards (no proprietary formats)

**Legal/Compliance Constraints**:
1. **Copyright**: Respect publisher copyright (no automated full-text scraping beyond fair use)
2. **API Terms**: Comply with Semantic Scholar, Zotero, other API terms of service
3. **Privacy**: No collection of user research data (local-first architecture)
4. **License**: MIT license compatible with all dependencies

### Assumptions

**User Assumptions**:
1. Users have basic command-line proficiency (can run `aiwg` commands)
2. Users understand fundamental research concepts (citations, literature review, quality assessment)

**Technical Assumptions**:
1. Node.js >=18.20.8 is available on target systems
2. Semantic Scholar API remains free and available
3. Zotero integration points remain stable
4. LLM APIs (Claude, OpenAI) remain available for AI-assisted operations
5. Markdown format remains viable for long-term documentation

**Adoption Assumptions**:
1. Researchers value reproducibility and FAIR principles enough to adopt tools
2. Matric ecosystem projects will serve as early validation cases
3. AIWG community will contribute to framework development
4. Open science movement continues to grow (increasing demand for tools)

**Risk Mitigation**:
