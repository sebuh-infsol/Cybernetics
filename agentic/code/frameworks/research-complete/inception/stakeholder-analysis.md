## 8. Stakeholder Analysis Summary

### Key Insights

1. **Diverse User Base**: Stakeholders range from developers needing quick research to academics requiring rigorous methodology. Framework must support progressive disclosure.

2. **Quality Standards Critical**: Multiple stakeholders (researchers, maintainers, docs writers) require high standards (PRISMA, FAIR, GRADE). These cannot be afterthoughts.

3. **Integration Key to Adoption**: AIWG users will only adopt if research integrates seamlessly with existing SDLC workflows. Downstream projects need migration support.

4. **Maintenance Burden**: Maintainers are highly influential but have limited capacity. Framework must minimize ongoing maintenance through automation and clear patterns.

5. **Community Contribution**: Success depends on active contributor community. Requires excellent onboarding, documentation, and recognition.

6. **Security Non-Negotiable**: Agent developers must follow security patterns. Automated enforcement required.

### Recommended Prioritization

**Phase 1 (Inception/Elaboration)**: Focus on high influence, high interest stakeholders
- AIWG Framework Users (primary personas)
- AIWG Project Maintainers (architecture approval)
- Agent Developers (agent specifications)

**Phase 2 (Construction)**: Expand to high interest stakeholders
- AI Researchers (methodology validation)
- Documentation Writers (template testing)
- Framework Contributors (onboarding)

**Phase 3 (Transition)**: Address downstream stakeholders
- matric-memory Project (pilot implementation)
- token-lifecycle Project (validation workflows)
- Research-Papers Repository (integration)

### Critical Success Factors

1. **Early Maintainer Buy-In**: Architecture must be approved by maintainers in Elaboration phase. Their high influence makes them veto holders.

2. **User Validation**: AIWG users must validate use cases and prototypes continuously. Their feedback drives feature prioritization.

3. **Academic Rigor**: AI researchers validate methodology compliance. Without their approval, framework lacks credibility.

4. **Clear Patterns**: Agent developers need clear, enforceable patterns. Inconsistency will create security risks and maintenance burden.

5. **Community Building**: Framework contributors are force multipliers. Investment in onboarding and recognition pays dividends.
