## 1. Solution Overview

### 1.1 Vision

The AIWG Research Framework provides AI coding assistants with specialized workflows, agents, and artifact management for managing research through its full lifecycle: discovery, acquisition, documentation, integration, and archival. It transforms ad-hoc research management into a structured, reproducible, FAIR-compliant process.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

**Current State**:
- Manual PDF management with no systematic discovery or validation
- Ad-hoc research organization lacking provenance tracking
- No automated gap analysis or quality assessment
- Claims lack citations and backing evidence
- Research workflows not reproducible
- No systematic progression from literature review to knowledge synthesis

**Pain Points Identified**:
- matric-memory professionalization (Issue #154, #155): documentation needs citations
- matric-eval benchmarking: requires research corpus of evaluation papers
- Research-papers repo: lacks automated discovery and integration tools
- No quality scoring mechanism for sources
- Manual citation network analysis

### 1.3 Proposed Solution

A complete framework (`agentic/code/frameworks/research-complete/`) providing:

1. **Structured Lifecycle Management**: PRISMA-inspired discovery through OAIS-compliant archival
2. **Specialized Agent System**: 8+ agents for discovery, acquisition, documentation, citation, quality assessment, provenance tracking, archival, and workflow orchestration
3. **Comprehensive Artifact Structure**: `.aiwg/research/` directory with discovery protocols, source metadata, knowledge graphs, quality assessments, provenance logs, and workflow definitions
4. **Quality Assurance**: GRADE-inspired evidence scoring, FAIR compliance validation, reproducibility tracking
5. **AI-Powered Capabilities**: LLM-assisted summarization (LitLLM patterns), citation network analysis, automated gap detection, knowledge graph construction

### 1.4 Success Vision

- Researchers spend less time on manual processes, more time on synthesis
- Every claim backed by traceable, quality-assessed sources
- Research workflows fully reproducible by others
- Automated discovery surfaces relevant sources proactively
- Knowledge graphs reveal connections not visible in isolation
- FAIR principles enforced automatically, not as afterthought
