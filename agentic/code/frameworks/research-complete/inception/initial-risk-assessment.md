## 1. Risk Assessment Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

This risk assessment identifies, evaluates, and prioritizes potential threats to the successful delivery of the AIWG Research Framework. It establishes mitigation strategies, assigns ownership, and defines monitoring approaches to proactively manage risks throughout the project lifecycle.

### 1.2 Assessment Scope

**Covered**:
- Technical risks (API dependencies, LLM accuracy, performance, integration)
- Integration risks (compatibility with existing tools, migration complexity)
- Resource risks (time constraints, skill gaps, budget limitations)
- Quality risks (data accuracy, source reliability, reproducibility)
- Adoption risks (learning curve, workflow disruption, user resistance)
- Security risks (API key management, data privacy, copyright compliance)
- Compliance risks (FAIR principles, standards adherence, licensing)

**Not Covered** (Out of Scope):
- Organizational change management (solo developer context)
- Market risks (open source project, no commercial dependencies)
- Competitive risks (niche academic tool space, minimal competition)

### 1.3 Risk Framework

## 5. Top 5 Risks (Detailed Analysis)

### 5.1 Risk T-01: LLM Hallucination in Summaries/Extractions (CRITICAL)

**Risk Score**: 20 (High Probability × Critical Impact)
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Owner**: Joseph Magly
**Status**: Open

#### Root Cause Analysis

**Primary Cause**: LLMs generate text based on statistical patterns, not factual databases, leading to plausible but fabricated content.

**Contributing Factors**:
- Training data contamination (internet sources with errors)
- Lack of source grounding during generation
- Context window limitations (entire PDFs don't fit, chunking required)
- No built-in citation verification in standard LLM APIs
- Pressure to generate coherent text even when uncertain

**5 Whys Analysis**:
1. Why do LLMs hallucinate? → They predict tokens based on patterns, not truth.
2. Why don't they verify facts? → No access to external databases during generation.
3. Why not use RAG? → RAG helps but doesn't eliminate hallucination (retrieval can be wrong).
4. Why is impact critical? → Research integrity depends on accurate citations; one false citation undermines credibility.
5. Why can't we eliminate risk? → Current LLM technology fundamentally probabilistic, not deterministic.

#### Impact Assessment

**Direct Impacts**:
- Users cite non-existent papers in publications → Scientific misconduct allegations
- Users trust false data extractions → Incorrect research conclusions
- Framework gains reputation as unreliable → Adoption collapse

**Indirect Impacts**:
- Time wasted verifying every AI output → Automation benefit negated
- Academic community rejects AI-assisted research tools → Movement backlash
- Solo developer burnout from constant bug reports → Project abandonment

**Stakeholder Impact**:
- **Researchers**: Career damage from citing false sources, institutional sanctions
- **AIWG Project**: Credibility destroyed, framework labeled as "dangerous"
- **Academic Community**: Erosion of trust in AI tools, regulatory overreach

**Quantitative Estimates**:
- 60% chance of hallucination in unconstrained LLM summarization (per research on GPT-3.5)
- 1 hallucinated citation per 10 papers = 100 false citations in 1,000-paper corpus
- 50+ hours required to manually verify and correct (5 mins/paper × 1,000)

#### Mitigation Strategies

**Primary Mitigation: RAG-Based Summarization (LitLLM Pattern)**
- **Action**: Use Retrieval-Augmented Generation, not free-form generation
- **How**: Chunk PDF, retrieve relevant chunks, ground generation in extracted text
- **Benefit**: 90%+ reduction in hallucination (per LitLLM paper)
- **Owner**: Joseph Magly
- **Timeline**: Phase 3 (Weeks 9-11)
- **Cost**: ~10 hours implementation

**Secondary Mitigation: Citation Verification**
- **Action**: Cross-reference all LLM-generated citations against DOI database (CrossRef API)
- **How**: Extract citations from summaries, validate DOI exists, flag mismatches
- **Benefit**: 100% detection of fabricated DOIs
- **Owner**: Joseph Magly
- **Timeline**: Phase 3 (Weeks 9-11)
- **Cost**: ~5 hours implementation

**Tertiary Mitigation: Human-in-the-Loop Verification**
- **Action**: Require user approval for all AI summaries before incorporation
- **How**: Display "AI-generated, not verified" warning, require explicit review step
- **Benefit**: Users aware of risk, can spot obvious errors
- **Owner**: Joseph Magly (design), Users (execution)
- **Timeline**: Phase 2 (Weeks 6-8)
- **Cost**: ~2 hours UI implementation

- **Benefit**: Early detection of systematic issues, user feedback loop
- **Owner**: Joseph Magly
- **Timeline**: Phase 3 (Weeks 9-11)
- **Cost**: ~3 hours implementation

#### Contingency Plans

**If Mitigation Fails (Hallucination Rate >10% Despite RAG)**:
1. **Fallback 1**: Disable AI summarization, require manual summaries
   - Impact: Major feature loss, workflow slows dramatically
   - Trigger: >10 hallucination reports in 100 papers
2. **Fallback 2**: Limit AI to extraction only (structured data), not prose summaries
   - Impact: Reduced value, users must write own summaries
   - Trigger: Critical hallucination causing user harm
3. **Fallback 3**: Use commercial API with better grounding (OpenAI with web search)
   - Impact: Requires budget ($50-100/month), may not be feasible
   - Trigger: Persistent issues, budget becomes available

**Emergency Response**:
- Immediate: Add "HIGH RISK OF HALLUCINATION" warning to all AI summaries
- Short-term: Halt Phase 3 development, focus on verification improvements

### 5.2 Risk A-04: Requires Too Much Manual Effort (CRITICAL)

**Risk Score**: 20 (Very High Probability × High Impact)
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Owner**: Joseph Magly
**Status**: Open

#### Root Cause Analysis

**Primary Cause**: High-quality research inherently requires human judgment; AI can assist but not replace critical thinking.

**Contributing Factors**:
- PRISMA screening requires reading abstracts (AI can pre-filter, not decide)
- GRADE quality assessment nuanced (study design, bias, consistency)
- Zettelkasten synthesis manual by design (emergence from linking)
- FAIR compliance needs human-readable metadata
- Gap analysis requires domain expertise (AI can suggest, not confirm)

**5 Whys Analysis**:
1. Why requires manual effort? → Research quality demands human expertise.
2. Why can't AI do it all? → AI lacks domain knowledge, critical thinking, contextual judgment.
3. Why not train better AI? → Domain-specific fine-tuning expensive, data scarce, generalization limited.
4. Why is effort high despite automation? → Automation handles volume (find 1,000 papers), not complexity (assess 1,000 papers).
5. Why does this risk adoption? → Users expect "AI magic button", reality disappoints → abandonment.

#### Impact Assessment

**Direct Impacts**:
- Users perceive framework as time-consuming, not time-saving
- Adoption limited to highly motivated researchers (dissertation students, grant-funded)
- Casual users abandon after initial trial
- Framework seen as "academic bloatware"

**Indirect Impacts**:
- Word-of-mouth negative ("tried it, too much work")
- Developer audience rejects framework (wants quick docs, not PRISMA)
- matric-memory professionalization stalls (team lacks time/motivation)
- Solo developer morale drops (users don't see value despite effort)

**Stakeholder Impact**:
- **Researchers**: Frustrated by unmet automation expectations
- **Developers**: See framework as unsuitable for "real world" software work
- **AIWG Project**: Framework usage minimal, development effort wasted

**Quantitative Estimates**:
- PRISMA screening: 60% reduction (per LLM research) = 40% still manual
  - Example: 500 papers screened → 200 manual reviews at 3 mins each = 10 hours
- Zettelkasten notes: ~15 mins per literature note (AI summary + manual synthesis)
  - Example: 100 papers → 25 hours note-taking
- GRADE assessment: ~10 mins per paper (AI extracts data, human judges quality)
  - Example: 50 papers → 8 hours quality scoring
- **Total**: ~43 hours manual work for 100-paper review (vs. ~100 hours fully manual = 57% reduction, but still significant)

#### Mitigation Strategies

**Primary Mitigation: Tiered Workflow Complexity**
- **Action**: Offer "Quick", "Standard", and "Rigorous" workflow presets
  - Quick: Skip PRISMA, basic quality (1-5 scale), minimal notes (AI summaries only)
  - Standard: PRISMA lite (AI pre-screening), GRADE essentials, literature notes
  - Rigorous: Full PRISMA, comprehensive GRADE, Zettelkasten synthesis
- **Benefit**: Users choose effort level matching needs (dev quick start vs. dissertation rigor)
- **Owner**: Joseph Magly
- **Timeline**: Phase 2 (Weeks 6-8)
- **Cost**: ~15 hours workflow design + templates

**Secondary Mitigation: Progressive Disclosure**
- **Action**: Start users with minimal workflow, unlock advanced features as needed
  - Onboarding: Simple discovery + acquisition only
  - Week 2: Introduce AI summaries
  - Week 3: Introduce quality scoring
  - Month 2: Introduce Zettelkasten, knowledge graphs
- **Benefit**: Users not overwhelmed, see value before committing effort
- **Owner**: Joseph Magly
- **Timeline**: Phase 6 (Weeks 18-20, documentation)
- **Cost**: ~8 hours tutorial design

**Tertiary Mitigation: Maximum Viable Automation**
- **Action**: Automate every possible step, even if imperfect
  - AI pre-screening: 80% recall threshold (filter out obvious non-matches)
  - AI quality scoring: Generate draft, user confirms/adjusts (not create from scratch)
  - AI gap detection: Suggest gaps, user validates (not manual brainstorming)
  - Auto-generate MoCs from permanent note tags (not manual organization)
- **Benefit**: Users review/refine AI output vs. start from blank page (5x faster)
- **Owner**: Joseph Magly
- **Timeline**: Phases 2-4 (Weeks 6-17)
- **Cost**: ~30 hours across all automation features

**Monitoring Mitigation: Effort Tracking & Benchmarking**
- **Action**: Log time spent on each workflow step, compare to manual baseline
  - Show users: "You've saved 15 hours vs. manual research" dashboard
  - Benchmark: Track median time per task, identify bottlenecks
- **Benefit**: Users see tangible value, developer identifies high-effort areas for improvement
- **Owner**: Joseph Magly
- **Timeline**: Phase 4 (Weeks 12-14)
- **Cost**: ~5 hours analytics implementation

#### Contingency Plans

**If Mitigation Fails (Users Still Report "Too Much Effort")**:
1. **Fallback 1**: Simplify to "Developer Mode" (discovery + summaries only, skip PRISMA/GRADE/Zettelkasten)
   - Impact: Framework becomes glorified bookmark manager, unique value lost
   - Trigger: >50% user feedback mentions excessive effort
2. **Fallback 2**: Focus on narrow use case (matric-memory professionalization only)
   - Impact: Broader adoption abandoned, framework becomes internal tool
   - Trigger: Early adopter feedback universally negative
3. **Fallback 3**: Pivot to "Research Assistant" vs. "Research Framework"
   - Impact: Lower user expectations (assistant suggests, user decides), reframe value prop
   - Trigger: Impossible to reduce effort further without compromising quality

**Emergency Response**:
- Immediate: Survey first 10 users for specific effort pain points
- Short-term: Prioritize automation for top 3 bottlenecks
- Long-term: Consider hiring/contracting UX specialist for workflow optimization

#### Early Warning Indicators

**Monitor These Metrics**:
1. **User Onboarding Completion Rate**: <50% complete first workflow → too complex
2. **Average Time per Workflow Step**: >2x estimated time → friction, unclear instructions
3. **Feature Usage**: <30% use Zettelkasten or GRADE → perceived as optional bloat
4. **User Retention**: <40% return after week 1 → initial effort discourages

**Review Cadence**:
- Weekly: Check onboarding completion and feature usage (Phase 6: user testing)
- Bi-weekly: User interviews (5 users) on effort pain points
- Monthly: Compare actual vs. estimated workflow times

#### Current Status

**Status**: Open (Risk Identified, Mitigation Planned)
**Next Actions**:
1. Design tiered workflow presets (Week 2)
2. Identify maximum automation opportunities (Week 3-4)
3. Build effort tracking analytics (Phase 4, Week 12-14)
4. User testing with effort focus (Phase 6, Week 18-19)

**Dependencies**:
- User research on acceptable effort levels (survey/interviews)
- Template library for quick-start workflows
- AI automation reliability (avoid creating more work debugging AI errors)

### 5.3 Risk R-01: Solo Developer Capacity Constraints (HIGH)

**Risk Score**: 16 (High Probability × High Impact)
**Priority**: HIGH
**Owner**: Joseph Magly
**Status**: Open

#### Root Cause Analysis

**Primary Cause**: Single developer working part-time (20-30 hrs/week) with competing priorities (AIWG core, matric projects, life).

**Contributing Factors**:
- No team to parallelize development (sequential work only)
- Unforeseen technical complexities (standards, integrations)
- Burnout risk from sustained high effort
- Illness, family emergencies, or other life events
- Scope creep temptation (add "just one more" feature)

**5 Whys Analysis**:
1. Why is capacity limited? → Solo developer, part-time availability.
2. Why not hire/recruit? → Zero budget, open source project, difficult to attract volunteers.
3. Why not reduce scope? → Already focused on MVP, further cuts risk unviable product.
4. Why is timeline aggressive? → matric-memory professionalization blocked, pressure to deliver.
5. Why is risk high? → 20 weeks ambitious for scope, any disruption causes slippage.

#### Impact Assessment

**Direct Impacts**:
- Missed milestones (Phase 1-2 delays cascade to later phases)
- Reduced scope (cut features to meet timeline, deliver less value)
- Technical debt (rushed implementation, inadequate testing)
- Project abandonment (sustained issues lead to burnout, giving up)

**Indirect Impacts**:
- matric-memory professionalization delayed indefinitely
- AIWG ecosystem stalls (no research foundation for other projects)
- Community trust eroded ("vaporware" reputation)
- Solo developer morale collapse, affects other projects

**Stakeholder Impact**:
- **matric-memory**: Professionalization blocked, continues informal documentation
- **Early Adopters**: Unmet expectations, negative word-of-mouth
- **AIWG Project**: Framework portfolio incomplete, strategic vision unmet

**Quantitative Estimates**:
- 20-week timeline @ 25 hrs/week = 500 hours budgeted
- 10% sick/vacation time = 450 hours available
- Unforeseen issues (20% contingency) = 360 effective hours
- Current scope estimate: ~400 hours (based on similar projects)
- **Gap**: 40 hours over capacity → ~2 weeks slippage risk

#### Mitigation Strategies

**Primary Mitigation: Ruthless Scope Prioritization (MoSCoW)**
- **Action**: Categorize all features as Must-Have, Should-Have, Could-Have, Won't-Have
  - **Must-Have** (MVP): Discovery + Acquisition agents, basic FAIR validation, simple quality scoring
  - **Should-Have** (v1.0): Documentation agent (LLM summaries), Citation agent, Zettelkasten templates
  - **Could-Have** (v1.1+): Knowledge graphs, OAIS compliance, W3C PROV, workflow orchestration
  - **Won't-Have** (v1): Real-time collab, advanced ML, visual editors
- **Benefit**: Clear prioritization, can cut Could-Have features if timeline pressure
- **Owner**: Joseph Magly
- **Timeline**: Week 1 (Inception phase, now)
- **Cost**: ~5 hours prioritization + stakeholder alignment

**Secondary Mitigation: Timeboxed Iterations (2-Week Sprints)**
- **Action**: Break 20-week timeline into 10 sprints, deliver working increment each sprint
  - Sprint review: Assess velocity (hours spent vs. work completed)
  - Adjust scope: If behind, move Should-Have → Could-Have
  - Celebrate wins: Maintain morale with tangible progress
- **Benefit**: Early detection of slippage, adaptive scope management, sustained momentum
- **Owner**: Joseph Magly
- **Timeline**: Weeks 3-20 (all development phases)
- **Cost**: ~2 hours/sprint planning + review = 20 hours total

**Tertiary Mitigation: Community Contribution Opportunities**
- **Action**: Identify "good first issue" tasks suitable for volunteers
  - Documentation: User guides, tutorials, examples
  - Templates: Additional search strategies, quality criteria, note templates
  - Integrations: Obsidian plugins, Zotero extensions (if volunteers emerge)
- **Benefit**: Offload non-critical work, build community, sustain long-term maintenance
- **Owner**: Joseph Magly (identification), Community (execution)
- **Timeline**: Phase 6 (Weeks 18-20, post-MVP)
- **Cost**: ~10 hours issue creation + mentorship

**Monitoring Mitigation: Burn-Down Tracking**
- **Action**: Track remaining work (story points or hours) vs. time remaining
  - Weekly: Update burn-down chart, identify trend (on track, behind, ahead)
  - Triggers: >10% behind → escalate, adjust scope
- **Benefit**: Quantitative visibility into timeline risk, data-driven decisions
- **Owner**: Joseph Magly
- **Timeline**: Weeks 3-20 (all development phases)
- **Cost**: ~1 hour/week tracking = 18 hours total

#### Contingency Plans

**If Timeline Slippage Occurs (>2 Weeks Behind)**:
1. **Fallback 1**: Extend timeline by 1 iteration (2 weeks)
   - Impact: matric-memory professionalization delayed, but quality maintained
   - Trigger: 50% into project, 2+ weeks behind
2. **Fallback 2**: Cut Should-Have features, deliver MVP only
   - Impact: Reduced v1.0 value, knowledge graphs and Zettelkasten deferred to v1.1
   - Trigger: 75% into project, 4+ weeks behind, extension not viable
3. **Fallback 3**: Deliver in phases (MVP v0.5, full v1.0 later)
   - Impact: Two release cycles, adoption split, but avoids total delay
   - Trigger: Critical personal issue (illness, emergency), cannot sustain pace

**Emergency Response**:
- Immediate: Communicate slippage to stakeholders (matric-memory, early adopters)
- Short-term: Reassess scope, identify cuts (prioritize matric-memory use case)
- Long-term: Recruit maintainer for post-v1.0 (offload to community)

#### Early Warning Indicators

**Monitor These Metrics**:
1. **Sprint Velocity**: <80% of planned work completed → capacity issue
2. **Burn-Down Trend**: Behind schedule for 2 consecutive sprints → escalate
3. **Unplanned Work**: >20% time on bugs/issues vs. features → scope creep
4. **Developer Well-Being**: Self-reported stress >7/10, sleep <6 hrs → burnout risk

**Review Cadence**:
- Weekly: Sprint review, burn-down update
- Bi-weekly: Velocity trend analysis
- Monthly: Personal well-being check, scope/timeline adjustment if needed

#### Current Status

**Status**: Open (Risk Identified, Mitigation Planned)
**Next Actions**:
1. Complete MoSCoW prioritization (Week 1, this week)
2. Set up sprint structure and burn-down tracking (Week 2)
3. Monitor velocity in first 2 sprints (Weeks 3-6), adjust if needed
4. Reassess timeline at 50% mark (Week 10)

**Dependencies**:
- Stakeholder buy-in on prioritization (matric-memory needs aligned with Must-Have scope)
- Discipline to avoid scope creep ("just one more feature" temptation)
- Personal health and life stability (unpredictable)

### 5.4 Risk Q-01: Low-Quality Source Data (HIGH)

**Risk Score**: 16 (High Probability × High Impact)
**Priority**: HIGH
**Owner**: Joseph Magly
**Status**: Open

#### Root Cause Analysis

**Primary Cause**: Research paper quality varies widely; open access repositories and preprint servers lack rigorous quality control.

**Contributing Factors**:
- Semantic Scholar aggregates from diverse sources (high-quality journals + low-quality preprints)
- Preprints (arXiv, bioRxiv) not peer-reviewed, may contain errors or retracted later
- Metadata quality varies (missing authors, incorrect DOIs, incomplete abstracts)
- Predatory publishers in open access space (pay-to-publish, no peer review)
- Retracted papers still indexed, not flagged consistently

**5 Whys Analysis**:
1. Why is source data low quality? → Open access prioritizes accessibility over curation.
2. Why accept low-quality sources? → Framework designed for comprehensive discovery (can't pre-filter too aggressively).
3. Why not use only high-quality journals? → Paywalls exclude most researchers, defeats FAIR principles.
4. Why is impact high? → GRADE scores unreliable → Users trust low-quality sources → Scientific errors.
5. Why can't we validate all sources? → Manual validation doesn't scale (100s of papers), automated metrics imperfect.

#### Impact Assessment

**Direct Impacts**:
- GRADE quality scores unreliable (garbage in, garbage out)
- Users cite low-quality or retracted papers in publications
- FAIR compliance validation fails (incomplete metadata)
- Framework credibility damaged ("helps you cite junk science")

**Indirect Impacts**:
- Academic community rejects framework (seen as enabling poor scholarship)
- Users must manually curate sources (negates automation value)
- Knowledge graphs polluted with low-quality nodes
- Reproducibility compromised (sources change, retract, or disappear)

**Stakeholder Impact**:
- **Researchers**: Career damage from citing retracted papers, institutional sanctions
- **Academic Community**: Erosion of research quality standards
- **AIWG Project**: Framework labeled as "dangerous" or "irresponsible"

**Quantitative Estimates**:
- Preprint error rate: ~5-10% contain significant errors or are retracted (per research on bioRxiv)
- Metadata completeness: ~20% of open access papers missing critical metadata (authors, DOIs, abstracts)
- Predatory publishers: ~10,000 active predatory journals (per Beall's List estimates)
- **Example**: 1,000-paper corpus → 50-100 low-quality sources, 200 with incomplete metadata

#### Mitigation Strategies

**Primary Mitigation: Multi-Dimensional Quality Scoring (GRADE-Inspired)**
- **Action**: Assess quality across multiple dimensions, not single metric
  - **Publication Venue**: Journal impact factor, predatory publisher check (Beall's List)
  - **Peer Review Status**: Preprint vs. peer-reviewed, retraction check (Retraction Watch)
  - **Citation Count**: Highly cited = community validation (with recency adjustment)
  - **Metadata Completeness**: FAIR compliance score (F-UJI pattern)
  - **Study Design**: RCT > Observational > Case Study (for empirical research)
- **Benefit**: Nuanced quality assessment, users see red flags, informed decisions
- **Owner**: Joseph Magly
- **Timeline**: Phase 3 (Weeks 9-11)
- **Cost**: ~20 hours quality scoring implementation

**Secondary Mitigation: Automated Retraction Checking**
- **Action**: Cross-reference all DOIs against Retraction Watch database
  - Flagged: "RETRACTED" badge on source, warning in summaries
  - Periodic re-check: Monthly scan for new retractions
- **Benefit**: 100% detection of known retractions, prevent citing retracted work
- **Owner**: Joseph Magly
- **Timeline**: Phase 2 (Weeks 6-8)
- **Cost**: ~5 hours integration with Retraction Watch API

**Tertiary Mitigation: User Education on Quality Assessment**
- **Action**: Provide guidelines and training on evaluating source quality
  - Tutorial: "How to Read a GRADE Score", "Red Flags in Research Papers"
  - Templates: Quality criteria checklists, bias assessment guides
  - Examples: Side-by-side comparison of high vs. low quality papers
- **Benefit**: Users develop critical evaluation skills, don't blindly trust framework scores
- **Owner**: Joseph Magly
- **Timeline**: Phase 6 (Weeks 18-20, documentation)
- **Cost**: ~8 hours tutorial creation

**Monitoring Mitigation: Quality Score Distribution Tracking**
- **Action**: Track distribution of quality scores across corpus
  - Alert: >30% low-quality sources → investigate search strategies (too broad?)
  - Benchmark: Compare to expert-curated corpora (validation)
- **Benefit**: Early detection of quality drift, data-driven search refinement
- **Owner**: Joseph Magly
- **Timeline**: Phase 3 (Weeks 9-11)
- **Cost**: ~3 hours analytics implementation

#### Contingency Plans

**If Mitigation Fails (Quality Scores Unreliable or Too Many Low-Quality Sources)**:
1. **Fallback 1**: Manual quality review required for all sources (human-in-the-loop)
   - Impact: Major workflow slowdown, automation value diminished
   - Trigger: >20% false positive/negative quality scores (user feedback)
2. **Fallback 2**: Restrict to curated sources only (e.g., PubMed, IEEE Xplore)
   - Impact: Accessibility reduced, paywalls exclude open science users
   - Trigger: Academic community feedback negative, quality issues systematic
3. **Fallback 3**: Explicit "Caveat Emptor" warnings, user assumes all risk
   - Impact: Framework credibility damaged, limited adoption
   - Trigger: Unable to improve quality scoring, accept limitations

**Emergency Response**:
- Immediate: Add "QUALITY NOT VERIFIED" warning to all sources
- Short-term: Pause discovery workflows, focus on quality scoring improvements
- Long-term: Partner with Retraction Watch, FAIR experts for validation

#### Early Warning Indicators

**Monitor These Metrics**:
1. **Retraction Rate**: >2% of corpus retracted within 6 months → source vetting insufficient
2. **Quality Score Complaints**: >10 user reports of incorrect scores → scoring algorithm flawed
3. **Low-Quality Source %**: >30% scored <3/5 → search strategies too broad
4. **Metadata Completeness**: <80% FAIR-compliant → source selection poor

**Review Cadence**:
- Weekly: Retraction check results
- Monthly: Quality score distribution analysis
- Quarterly: User survey on trust in quality assessments

#### Current Status

**Status**: Open (Risk Identified, Mitigation Planned)
**Next Actions**:
1. Research GRADE framework adaptation for papers (Week 2)
2. Integrate Retraction Watch API (Phase 2, Week 6-8)
3. Design quality scoring algorithm (Phase 3, Week 9)
4. Validate scoring with expert-curated corpus (Phase 3, Week 11)

**Dependencies**:
- Retraction Watch API access (free tier availability)
- Beall's List or alternative predatory publisher database
- Expert validation corpus (e.g., Cochrane reviews for medical papers)

### 5.5 Risk A-01: Steep Learning Curve (HIGH)

**Risk Score**: 16 (High Probability × High Impact)
**Priority**: HIGH
**Owner**: Joseph Magly
**Status**: Open

#### Root Cause Analysis

**Primary Cause**: Framework integrates multiple complex methodologies (PRISMA, GRADE, Zettelkasten, FAIR, PROV) unfamiliar to typical users.

**Contributing Factors**:
- Academic standards jargon-heavy (GRADE "risk of bias", FAIR "interoperability")
- Zettelkasten method counterintuitive (atomic notes, emergent structure vs. hierarchical folders)
- Extensive artifact structure (8 subdirectories, 10+ file types)
- Many new concepts (MoCs, permanent notes, W3C PROV, OAIS SIP/AIP/DIP)
- No existing mental models (most users familiar with Zotero + Word, not systematic frameworks)

**5 Whys Analysis**:
1. Why is learning curve steep? → Many new concepts and workflows.
2. Why not simplify? → Standards compliance requires rigor (PRISMA can't be simplified without losing validity).
3. Why target users unfamiliar? → Most researchers lack systematic review training.
4. Why is impact high? → Users overwhelmed → abandon framework → adoption failure.
5. Why not better onboarding? → Solo developer time-constrained, documentation deferred to Phase 6.

#### Impact Assessment

**Direct Impacts**:
- User abandonment after initial trial (download framework, try once, give up)
- Negative word-of-mouth ("too complicated", "over-engineered")
- Limited adoption beyond academic niche (only systematic review experts)
- Framework seen as "for PhDs only"

**Indirect Impacts**:
- matric-memory team resists adoption (learning curve > perceived benefit)
- Developer audience rejects framework (wants simple tool, not academic course)
- Solo developer morale drops (users don't see value despite effort)
- Documentation burden increases (constant "how do I..." questions)

**Stakeholder Impact**:
- **Casual Researchers**: Overwhelmed, stick with ad-hoc methods
- **Developers**: Perceive framework as unsuitable for "real world" work
- **AIWG Project**: Framework usage minimal, strategic vision unmet

**Quantitative Estimates**:
- Estimated learning time:
  - Basic discovery + acquisition: 1-2 hours (acceptable)
  - PRISMA protocol understanding: 3-4 hours (research + practice)
  - GRADE quality assessment: 2-3 hours
  - Zettelkasten method: 5-6 hours (paradigm shift from folders)
  - Full framework proficiency: 15-20 hours
- User tolerance: ~2-5 hours before abandonment (per UX research on tool adoption)
- **Gap**: 15 hours required vs. 5 hours tolerated = 10-hour adoption barrier

#### Mitigation Strategies

**Primary Mitigation: Progressive Onboarding with Quick Wins**
- **Action**: Structure learning in stages, deliver value at each stage
  - **Stage 1** (30 mins): Discover 10 papers via API, download PDFs (instant value)
  - **Stage 2** (1 hour): AI summarize papers, basic quality scoring (tangible benefit)
  - **Stage 3** (2 hours): PRISMA protocol, systematic screening (methodology upgrade)
  - **Stage 4** (4 hours): Zettelkasten notes, knowledge graphs (synthesis capabilities)
  - **Stage 5** (8+ hours): Full FAIR/PROV compliance, reproducibility (academic rigor)
- **Benefit**: Users see value before investing effort, can stop at any stage if needs met
- **Owner**: Joseph Magly
- **Timeline**: Phase 6 (Weeks 18-20, documentation)
- **Cost**: ~15 hours tutorial design + interactive walkthrough

  - **Zettelkasten**: "A note-taking method that helps ideas connect themselves"
  - **FAIR**: "Rules to make sure your research data is usable by others"
  - **W3C PROV**: "A record of where each piece of data came from"
- **Benefit**: Reduces intimidation, users understand purpose before learning mechanics
- **Owner**: Joseph Magly
- **Timeline**: Phase 6 (Weeks 18-20, documentation)
- **Cost**: ~5 hours glossary creation

**Tertiary Mitigation: Template Library with Examples**
- **Action**: Provide pre-filled templates and real-world examples
  - Search strategy template: Example for "AI agent research"
  - Quality criteria template: Example for "software engineering papers"
  - Literature note template: Example from REF-001-prisma-statement.md
  - MoC template: Example for "Research Methodologies" topic
- **Benefit**: Users learn by example (fastest learning method), copy-paste-adapt vs. create from scratch
- **Owner**: Joseph Magly
- **Timeline**: Phase 6 (Weeks 18-20, documentation)
- **Cost**: ~10 hours template creation + examples

**Monitoring Mitigation: Onboarding Analytics**
- **Action**: Track where users drop off in onboarding flow
  - Metric: % completing Stage 1, Stage 2, etc.
  - Alert: <50% complete Stage 2 → Stage 1-2 gap too large, simplify
- **Benefit**: Data-driven onboarding improvements, identify exact friction points
- **Owner**: Joseph Magly
- **Timeline**: Phase 6 (Weeks 19-20, user testing)
- **Cost**: ~5 hours analytics implementation

#### Contingency Plans

**If Mitigation Fails (Users Still Report "Too Complicated")**:
1. **Fallback 1**: Create "Simple Mode" (discovery + summaries only, hide advanced features)
   - Impact: Framework value reduced, unique features hidden
   - Trigger: >60% users never progress past Stage 2
2. **Fallback 2**: Video tutorials instead of written docs (more accessible)
   - Impact: Production time-intensive, maintenance burden (videos outdated quickly)
   - Trigger: User feedback requests visual learning
3. **Fallback 3**: Focus on single use case (matric-memory professionalization only)
   - Impact: Broader adoption abandoned, framework becomes internal tool
   - Trigger: Early adopter feedback universally negative

**Emergency Response**:
- Immediate: Survey first 10 users for specific confusion points
- Short-term: Simplify top 3 confusing areas (rename, redesign, remove)
- Long-term: Consider hiring technical writer or UX specialist

#### Early Warning Indicators

**Monitor These Metrics**:
1. **Onboarding Completion**: <50% complete full tutorial → too complex
2. **Time to First Value**: >1 hour to discover first papers → friction too early
3. **Support Questions**: >10 "how do I..." questions on same topic → docs unclear
4. **Feature Usage**: <30% use Zettelkasten or knowledge graphs → too advanced, users don't reach

**Review Cadence**:
- Weekly: Onboarding completion rates (Phase 6: user testing)
- Bi-weekly: Support question analysis (identify trends)
- Monthly: User interview (5 users) on learning experience

#### Current Status

**Status**: Open (Risk Identified, Mitigation Planned)

### 6.2 Budget Summary

**Total Risk Mitigation Budget**: ~220 hours (44% of 500-hour project budget)

**Breakdown**:
- Critical risks: 71 hours (14%)
- High risks: 129 hours (26%)
- Medium risks: 15 hours (3%)
- Monitoring/contingency: 5 hours (1%)

**Justification**: High-risk project (new domain, complex standards, solo developer) warrants substantial risk management investment.

### 6.3 Risk Ownership

**All Risks**: Joseph Magly (solo developer)

**Post-v1.0 Community Roles** (aspirational):
- **Quality Assurance**: Community contributors validate quality scoring
- **Documentation**: Technical writer (volunteer or hired) improves onboarding
- **Support**: Community forum moderators answer user questions

### 6.4 Escalation Path

**Solo Developer Context**: No formal escalation, but decision triggers:

1. **Critical Risk Triggered** (T-01, A-04):
   - Stop current work, address immediately
   - Reassess timeline/scope, communicate to stakeholders

2. **High Risk Triggered** (R-01, Q-01, A-01, I-04, A-02):
   - Escalate to weekly review (vs. bi-weekly)
   - Activate contingency plan
   - Adjust scope if needed

3. **Multiple Medium Risks Triggered**:
   - Formal project reassessment
   - Consider pausing for replanning

## 7. Risk Monitoring Approach

### 7.1 Monitoring Cadence

**Weekly** (During Development, Weeks 3-20):
- Sprint burn-down review (R-01)
- Hallucination reports check (T-01)
- API rate limit alerts (T-02)
- Developer well-being self-assessment (R-01)

**Bi-Weekly**:
- Velocity trend analysis (R-01)
- Quality score distribution (Q-01)
- User feedback review (A-01, A-04)

**Monthly**:
- Comprehensive risk register review (all risks)
- User surveys (effort, learning curve, trust in AI)
- Retraction check sweep (Q-01)
- Standards compliance validation (C-02, C-03)

**Phase Milestones**:
- End of each phase (Weeks 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20): Formal risk reassessment

### 7.2 Monitoring Metrics

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**:

| Risk | Metric | Target | Alert Threshold |
|------|--------|--------|-----------------|
| T-01 | Hallucination rate | <5% | >10% |
| A-04 | Time savings vs. manual | >60% | <40% |
| R-01 | Sprint velocity | 100% of planned | <80% for 2 sprints |
| Q-01 | Low-quality source % | <10% | >30% |
| A-01 | Onboarding completion | >70% | <50% |
| T-02 | API rate limit hits | 0/month | >3/month |
| Q-02 | Gap analysis accuracy | >90% | <80% |
| C-02 | FAIR compliance rate | 100% | <90% |

**Monitoring Tools**:
- Spreadsheet tracking (manual, weekly updates)
- Analytics dashboard (Phase 4+, automated metrics)
- User survey platform (Google Forms or similar)
- Issue tracker labels (GitHub: "risk:critical", "risk:high", etc.)

### 7.3 Reporting

**Internal** (Solo Developer):
- Weekly: Personal risk review, update register
- Monthly: Formal writeup of risk status, trends, actions

**External** (Stakeholders: matric-memory, early adopters):
- Phase milestones: Risk status summary in phase review
- Critical issues: Immediate communication (email, GitHub issue)
- Monthly: Optional transparency report (blog post or GitHub discussion)

### 7.4 Risk Register Maintenance

**Updates**:
- Add new risks as identified during development
- Close risks when fully mitigated or no longer applicable
- Adjust probability/impact as new information emerges
- Log all mitigation actions taken and results

**Archive**:
- Closed risks moved to "Risk Archive" section (not deleted, for lessons learned)
- Final risk register published with v1.0 release (transparency)

---

## 8. Next Review Date

**Next Formal Review**: 2026-02-15 (End of Elaboration Phase, Week 5)

**Review Scope**:
- Reassess all risks based on Phases 1-2 progress
- Update probability/impact for Technical and Resource risks (most visibility by then)
- Identify new risks discovered during architecture and infrastructure work
- Validate mitigation strategies (which worked, which didn't)
- Adjust timeline/scope if R-01 (capacity) or Q-01 (quality) triggered

**Subsequent Reviews**:
- 2026-03-15: End of Documentation phase (Week 11)
- 2026-04-15: End of Integration phase (Week 14)
- 2026-05-15: End of Workflows phase (Week 17)
- 2026-06-05: End of Validation phase (Week 20, v1.0 release)

**Ad-Hoc Reviews**:
- Triggered by any Critical risk activation
- Triggered by 3+ High risks activating simultaneously
- Triggered by major external change (API deprecation, LLM breakthrough, competitor launch)

## 9. Conclusion

### 9.1 Risk Profile Summary

**Overall Risk Level**: **HIGH**

**Justification**:
- 2 Critical priority risks (hallucination, manual effort)
- 5 High priority risks (capacity, quality, learning curve, migration, workflow disruption)
- Complex domain (academic standards, AI integration, open science)
- Solo developer with limited resources
- Ambitious timeline (20 weeks for comprehensive framework)

**Risk Concentration**:
- **Technical Risks** (8 total): Moderate concern, AI/LLM risks most critical
- **Adoption Risks** (4 total): High concern, user experience make-or-break
- **Resource Risks** (4 total): High concern, capacity constraints real
- **Quality Risks** (4 total): High concern, data quality foundational
- **Integration Risks** (4 total): Low concern, mostly addressed by standards
- **Security Risks** (3 total): Low concern, standard practices adequate
- **Compliance Risks** (4 total): Moderate concern, standards learning curve

### 9.2 Risk Mitigation Confidence

**High Confidence Mitigations**:
- RAG-based summarization (proven technique, LitLLM precedent)
- MoSCoW prioritization (standard project management)
- Retraction checking (straightforward API integration)
- Progressive onboarding (established UX pattern)

**Moderate Confidence Mitigations**:
- GRADE quality scoring (complex domain, implementation uncertainty)
- Maximum automation (AI reliability variable)
- Community contributions (depends on attracting volunteers)

**Low Confidence Mitigations**:
- Gap analysis accuracy (AI limitations, domain complexity)
- Effort reduction to acceptable levels (research inherently time-consuming)

### 9.3 Go/No-Go Recommendation

**Recommendation**: **GO** (Proceed with Project)

**Rationale**:
- Despite HIGH overall risk, all Critical and High risks have viable mitigations
- Incremental approach (MVP → v1.0) allows early validation and pivot
- Value proposition strong (professionalize matric-memory, enable research-backed development)
- Risk management budget (220 hours) incorporated into timeline
- Solo developer willing to accept risks and execute mitigations

**Conditions**:
1. **Ruthless Scope Discipline**: MoSCoW prioritization enforced, no scope creep
2. **Weekly Monitoring**: Burn-down tracking, metric reviews, early issue detection
3. **Stakeholder Alignment**: matric-memory team committed to adoption despite learning curve
4. **Contingency Acceptance**: Timeline extension (±2 weeks) acceptable if needed
5. **Quality Gates**: Hallucination rate <5%, FAIR compliance 100%, onboarding <5 hours

**Red Lines** (Stop Project if Crossed):
- Sustained >80% capacity for 4+ weeks (burnout risk, R-01)
- Hallucination rate >20% despite RAG mitigation (fundamental AI failure, T-01)
- User feedback universally negative (>80% "too complex" or "too much effort")
- Critical compliance failure (copyright lawsuit, C-01)

### 9.4 Key Success Factors

To mitigate risks and ensure project success:

1. **Start Simple, Grow Complex**: MVP focus, add rigor incrementally
2. **Validate Early**: matric-memory dogfooding in Phase 2-3, not Phase 6
3. **Automate Relentlessly**: Every manual step = adoption barrier
4. **Educate Users**: Glossary, tutorials, examples (don't assume knowledge)
5. **Monitor Metrics**: Data-driven decisions, not assumptions
6. **Communicate Risks**: Transparent about limitations (FAIR, AI hallucination)
7. **Celebrate Wins**: Maintain morale through 20-week marathon

### 9.5 Lessons Learned (Preemptive)

**Anticipated Lessons** (to revisit at v1.0):
- How well did RAG mitigate hallucination? (T-01)
- Was tiered workflow effective or confusing? (A-04)
- Did MoSCoW prevent scope creep? (R-01)
- Was 20-week timeline realistic? (adjust for future projects)
- Which risks didn't materialize? (over-mitigation?)
- Which risks emerged unexpectedly? (blind spots?)
