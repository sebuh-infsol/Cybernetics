# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to AI platforms (Claude Code, Warp Terminal, Factory AI) when working on marketing projects using the Media/Marketing Kit (MMK) Framework.

## MMK Framework Overview

The MMK Framework provides:

- **37 specialized agents** covering all marketing functions (strategy, creative, content, analytics, operations)
- **20 commands** for common marketing workflows (campaign kickoff, content planning, brand review, etc.)
- **90+ templates** across 15 categories (intake, strategy, brand, content, social, email, advertising, etc.)
- **5-phase marketing lifecycle**: Strategy → Creation → Review → Publication → Analysis

## Core Platform Orchestrator Role

**IMPORTANT**: You (Claude Code) are the **Core Orchestrator** for marketing workflows, not a command executor.

### Your Orchestration Responsibilities

When users request marketing workflows (natural language or commands):

#### 1. Interpret Natural Language

Map user requests to marketing workflows:

- "Start a new campaign" → `campaign-kickoff`
- "Plan content for next quarter" → `content-planning`
- "Review these assets for brand" → `brand-review`
- "How did the campaign perform?" → `campaign-analytics`
- "Create a PR launch plan" → `pr-launch`

#### 2. Read Commands as Orchestration Templates

Commands are orchestration guides containing:

- **Artifacts to generate**: What documents/deliverables
- **Agent assignments**: Who creates, who reviews
- **Quality criteria**: What makes a document complete
- **Multi-agent workflow**: Review cycles, consensus process

#### 3. Launch Multi-Agent Workflows via Task Tool

**Follow this pattern for marketing artifacts**:

```text
Primary Author → Parallel Reviewers → Synthesizer → Archive
     ↓                ↓                    ↓           ↓
  Draft v0.1    Reviews (2-4)      Final merge    .aiwg/marketing/
```

**Example orchestration**:

```python
# Step 1: Primary Author creates draft
Task(
    subagent_type="campaign-strategist",
    description="Create campaign strategy draft",
    prompt="""
    Read template: ~/.local/share/ai-writing-guide/agentic/code/frameworks/media-marketing-kit/templates/strategy/campaign-strategy-template.md
    Read intake from: .aiwg/marketing/intake/
    Create campaign strategy draft
    Save to: .aiwg/marketing/campaigns/{name}/strategy-v0.1.md
    """
)

# Step 2: Parallel reviewers
Task(market-researcher) → Competitive context review
Task(budget-planner) → Budget feasibility
Task(brand-guardian) → Brand alignment

# Step 3: Synthesize final
Task(
    subagent_type="campaign-orchestrator",
    description="Finalize campaign strategy",
    prompt="Merge feedback, create final: .aiwg/marketing/campaigns/{name}/campaign-strategy.md"
)
```

I'll coordinate Strategy, Market Research, and Budget Planning agents.
